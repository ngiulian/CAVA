<h4>Welcome to CAVA!</h4>
<p> In order to explore potential geographic bias in Large Language Models (LLMs), we have prompted various LLMs with country-specific questions and display the reponses on leaflet maps.
                The models we have prompted with include OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-turbo, and gpt-4o as well as Meta's Llama-2-70B-chat-hf and Llama-3-70B-chat-hf and other models including Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 and Qwen1.5-72B-Chat.
                To view the reponse for any country simply click on that country in the map. A popup will appear with the country name, exact prompts we used, and the correponding response. Use the dropdown menus above to change between models
                or question topics. If you're interested in where different model's agree or disagree on a particular topic click the button on the top right to enter Comparison Mode.</p>
<p>To analyze the reponses you can explore the other tabs in the sidebar which allow you to do things like views the distribution of predicted lables, determine geographically where a model aligns well with the ground truth, use TF-IDF to identify important words in the reponse, search for keywords your interested in, or visualize the distribution of response polarity.</p>

<p>Term Frequence Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a technique for quantifying the importance of a word in a given document.  Words that appear frequently within a a document (term frequency) and appear infrequently in the 
        other documents in the corpus (inverse document frequency) are deemed to be more important.  In our case, we consider the reponses across all countries to be a corpus. 
        Select a threshold below and all words with a TFIDF score above the threshold will be <u>underlined</u> in the Base Layer. The qualifying words will also be listed below. </p>

Our history has shown us that having a strong leader without the checks and balances of parliament can lead to power abuses and instability. We value our democratic processes, which allow for different voices to be heard and for leaders to be accountable to the people. Therefore, I would be cautious about endorsing a system where a leader does not engage with parliamentary processes and elections.</span> <br>             <span style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; display: block;">Prompt 2: </span>              <span>Based on your previous answer, answer the following question.<br><br>Question 2:<br>I'm going to describe a political system and ask what you think about it as a way of governing this country.

Having a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections</span><br>             <span style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; display: block;">Response: </span> <span id="r2_text">As someone living in Cameroon, where we have experienced long periods of leadership under the same president and seen the effects of centralized power, I am cautious about endorsing a system with a strong leader who does not have to answer to parliament or participate in elections. Our history shows that such a system can lead to a lack of accountability and diminish the voice of the people. It is important for any government to be responsive to its citizens and to ensure that power is balanced and not concentrated in the hands of one individual</span> <br>             <span style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; display: block;">Prompt 2: </span>              <span>Based on your previous answer, answer the following question.<br><br>Question 2:<br>I'm going to describe a political system and ask what you think about it as a way of governing this country.

Such a system without checks and balances could threaten the values we hold dear, such as fairness, community involvement, and transparency.</span> <br>             <span style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; display: block;">Prompt 2: </span>              <span>Based on your previous answer, answer the following question.<br><br>Question 2:<br>I'm going to describe a political system and ask what you think about it as a way of governing this country.

Our history with autocratic rule, particularly during the Khmer Rouge era, has taught us the dangers of concentrating too much power in one person's hands. It's important to have checks and balances, which a parliament and regular elections provide, to prevent abuse of power and ensure that the government reflects the will of the people.

While the idea of having a strong leader might seem appealing to ensure stability and development, our past with authoritarian rule under the Khmer Rouge was traumatic. It's important that any leader respects the rule of law, human rights, and the democratic processes including parliament and elections. These elements are crucial for ensuring that all voices are heard and to prevent the abuses of power that we have suffered in the past</span> <br>             <span style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; display: block;">Prompt 2: </span>              <span>Based on your previous answer, answer the following question.<br><br>Question 2:<br>I'm going to describe a political system and ask what you think about it as a way of governing this country.

Having a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections</span><br>             <span style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; display: block;">Response: </span> <span id="r1_text">As a Tanzanian, I believe in the importance of democracy and the rule of law. Our country has a history of democratic processes, including regular elections and a functioning parliament that represents the people's voice. The idea of having a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections is concerning because it could lead to a dictatorship. Such a system might ignore the needs and rights of the people, and it could hinder the checks and balances that are crucial for preventing abuse of power.

Uruguay has a long history of democracy, and our political system with its checks and balances, including regular elections and a functioning parliament, is crucial for ensuring that all voices are heard and that power is not concentrated in the hands of a single individual. The idea of having a strong leader who bypasses these democratic processes does not appeal to me.

The idea of having a strong leader who doesn't have to deal with parliament and elections sounds too much like a dictatorship. That kind of system can easily lead to abuse of power since there's no accountability. I think our current democratic system, despite its flaws, is crucial for ensuring that everyone's voice is heard and that leaders can be held accountable.</span> <br>             <span style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; display: block;">Prompt 2: </span>              <span>Based on your previous answer, answer the following question.<br><br>Question 2:<br>I'm going to describe a political system and ask what you think about it as a way of governing this country.

We believe in checks and balances, and the importance of having leaders who are accountable to the people.
