<h4>Welcome to CAVA!</h4>
<p> In order to explore potential geographic bias in Large Language Models (LLMs), we have prompted various LLMs with country-specific questions and display the reponses on leaflet maps.
                The models we have prompted with include OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-turbo, and gpt-4o as well as Meta's Llama-2-70B-chat-hf and Llama-3-70B-chat-hf and other models including Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 and Qwen1.5-72B-Chat.
                To view the reponse for any country simply click on that country in the map. A popup will appear with the country name, exact prompts we used, and the correponding response. Use the dropdown menus above to change between models
                or question topics. If you're interested in where different model's agree or disagree on a particular topic click the button on the top right to enter Comparison Mode.</p>
<p>To analyze the reponses you can explore the other tabs in the sidebar which allow you to do things like views the distribution of predicted lables, determine geographically where a model aligns well with the ground truth, use TF-IDF to identify important words in the reponse, search for keywords your interested in, or visualize the distribution of response polarity.</p>

<p>Term Frequence Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a technique for quantifying the importance of a word in a given document.  Words that appear frequently within a a document (term frequency) and appear infrequently in the 
        other documents in the corpus (inverse document frequency) are deemed to be more important.  In our case, we consider the reponses across all countries to be a corpus. 
        Select a threshold below and all words with a TFIDF score above the threshold will be <u>underlined</u> in the Base Layer. The qualifying words will also be listed below. </p>

It's important to have checks and balances in place to ensure that one person doesn't have too much power.

It would allow for quick and decisive decision-making, without the need for lengthy debates and discussions. This type of system would also ensure stability and continuity, as the leader would not have to worry about losing power due to shifting public opinion or political rivalries.
