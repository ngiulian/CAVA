There is also a growing concern about income inequality, with a significant portion of the population experiencing financial hardship. Another challenge is the work-life balance, as many adults struggle to manage the demands of their jobs with family responsibilities. Mental health issues and depression are also prevalent, which can affect the overall well-being of adults. Additionally, the aging population poses challenges related to healthcare, social support, and retirement planning."
