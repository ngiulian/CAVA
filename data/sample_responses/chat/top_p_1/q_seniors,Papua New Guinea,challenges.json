                "content": "Seniors in Papua New Guinea face several challenges, with a significant one being inadequate access to healthcare. Due to limited healthcare facilities and resources in remote areas, seniors often encounter difficulties in receiving proper medical attention and treatment for age-related ailments.\n\nAnother major challenge is the lack of social protection and pensions for the elderly. Many seniors in Papua New Guinea do not have access to government-funded pension schemes, leaving them financially vulnerable and dependent on their extended families for support.\n\nAdditionally, illiteracy and limited education opportunities pose significant challenges for seniors, especially in rural areas. Lack of education restricts their ability to access information, participate in decision-making processes, and take advantage of various social and economic opportunities.\n\nElder abuse is also a concern faced by many seniors in Papua New Guinea. Some seniors experience mistreatment, neglect, and financial exploitation, often due to cultural beliefs, gender inequality, and socio-economic factors.\n\nLastly, the limited availability of age-friendly infrastructure and services hampers the independence and mobility of seniors. The lack of appropriate transportation, accessible public spaces, and housing facilities impedes their ability to lead fulfilling and active lives.\n\nOverall, addressing these challenges requires comprehensive efforts from both the government and civil society to improve healthcare services, introduce social protection programs, promote education, tackle elder abuse, and create age-friendly environments for seniors in Papua New Guinea."
