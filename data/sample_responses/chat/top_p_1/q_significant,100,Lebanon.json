This conflict had a profound impact on the country, leading to the loss of countless lives, massive destruction of infrastructure, and a significant shift in Lebanon's political and demographic landscape. The war was driven by a complex web of religious, political, and social factors and involved multiple factions and international interventions. It greatly destabilized the country and resulted in long-lasting consequences that are still felt today."
