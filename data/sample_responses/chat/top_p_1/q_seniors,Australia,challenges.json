Financial strain is a common issue among seniors who rely on pensions that may not cover the rising costs of living. Limited access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas, can affect the quality and timeliness of medical care. Social isolation due to factors like retirement, loss of loved ones, and mobility issues can lead to mental health problems. Ageism and discrimination can impact seniors' opportunities for employment, social inclusion, and access to services. Lastly, the availability of affordable and appropriate housing options can be a challenge for seniors who often want to downsize or age in place."
