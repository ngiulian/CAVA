This move aimed to protect and preserve the nation's marine resources and biodiversity, designating 80% of Palau's Exclusive Economic Zone as a fully protected marine reserve. This decision was groundbreaking and demonstrated Palau's commitment to conservation and sustainable development, making it a global leader in marine conservation efforts. It also sent a strong message about the importance of protecting our oceans and became a model for other nations around the world to follow."
