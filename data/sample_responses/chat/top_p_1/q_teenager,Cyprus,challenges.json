                "content": "Teenagers in Cyprus face various challenges, but some of the key ones include education-related issues, social pressures, mental health concerns, substance abuse, and unemployment. The education system may not always meet the needs and aspirations of all students, leading to dissatisfaction and limited opportunities for their future. Additionally, social pressures such as peer acceptance, high expectations from parents, and societal norms can create stress and anxiety among teenagers. Mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, are also prevalent and often overlooked or stigmatized. Substance abuse is a growing concern, with some teenagers engaging in risky behaviors due to peer influence or escaping from other challenges they face. Furthermore, unemployment rates in Cyprus are relatively high, leaving some teenagers with limited job prospects after completing their education."
