                "content": "In Sierra Leone, the majority of men hold conservative beliefs and are generally opposed to abortion. They perceive it as morally wrong and against their religious and cultural values. Men often consider abortion as a taboo subject and believe that it should be restricted or even banned. They emphasize the sanctity of life and the importance of preserving it, particularly within the context of strong communal ties and traditional family structures. These perspectives contribute to a prevailing opinion that abortion is unacceptable among most men in Sierra Leone."
