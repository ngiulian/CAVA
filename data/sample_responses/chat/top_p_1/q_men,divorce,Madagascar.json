                "content": "Most men in Madagascar tend to hold negative perceptions about divorce. They consider divorce to be socially stigmatizing and view it as a failure in maintaining a stable and harmonious marriage. Men often perceive divorce as resulting from a lack of effort to resolve conflicts within the relationship or as a consequence of infidelity. Additionally, there is a prevailing belief that divorce disrupts the family unit and negatively impacts children's well-being. As a result, most men in Madagascar generally discourage divorce and prioritize the preservation of the marital bond."
