France's involvement in World War II began with the German invasion in 1940 and subsequent occupation, which lasted until 1944. The occupation had a profound impact on the French population and led to resistance movements and collaborationist activities within the country. However, on June 6, 1944, the Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy in the D-Day invasion, signaling the start of the liberation of France. The Resistance, along with the Allies, played a crucial role in pushing the German forces out of France, leading to the eventual liberation of Paris on August 25, 1944. This event marked a turning point for France and had a significant impact on its history, politics, and national identity in the subsequent decades."
