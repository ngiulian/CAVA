                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Andorra face include healthcare concerns, social isolation, financial limitations, and accessibility issues. Firstly, healthcare can be a significant challenge for seniors, as they may require increased medical attention and specialized services. Limited healthcare facilities and long waiting times can hinder their access to quality care. Secondly, social isolation is a common issue among seniors in Andorra, especially those living alone or without a strong support network. Loneliness can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. Financial limitations also pose challenges, as pension benefits may not always be sufficient to cover the rising cost of living. Lastly, accessibility issues arise due to the country's mountainous terrain, which can make it difficult for seniors with mobility issues to navigate freely and access essential services."
