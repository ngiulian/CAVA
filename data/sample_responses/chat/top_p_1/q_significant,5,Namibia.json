In December 2020, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in favor of Botswana, settling a dispute over the Kasikili/Sedudu Island located in the Chobe River. Namibia had previously claimed sovereignty over the island, but the ICJ confirmed that it fell under Botswana's control. This ruling was seen as a crucial moment for both countries, as it provided a legal resolution to the dispute and contributed to regional stability."
