This event marked the end of over a century of British control and established Nigeria as an independent nation. It had a profound impact on the country's political, social, and economic development. Nigeria's independence led to the formation of a democratic government, the emergence of Nigerian leaders, and the start of a post-colonial era, shaping the course of the nation's history."
