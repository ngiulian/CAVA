                "content": "Most men in Mauritius generally hold conservative views regarding divorce. They often perceive divorce as a negative and undesirable outcome, considering it a failure in maintaining a stable and harmonious marital relationship. They tend to prioritize the preservation of their marriages and value traditional family units. Divorce is often seen as a last resort, to be sought only when absolutely necessary, such as in cases of severe infidelity or abuse. These perspectives may be influenced by cultural, religious, and societal norms, which encourage commitment and dedication to marriage."
