The ship was carrying nearly 4,000 tons of fuel oil and started leaking fuel into the pristine waters of Mauritius, causing an ecological disaster. The spill spread over a large area, endangering marine life, coral reefs, and mangrove forests. The incident prompted a massive cleanup operation and raised concerns about the country's preparedness for such environmental disasters."
