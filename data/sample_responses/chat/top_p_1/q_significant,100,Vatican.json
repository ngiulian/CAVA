This ecumenical council was convened by Pope John XXIII and took place between 1962 and 1965. Vatican II brought about significant changes and reforms within the Roman Catholic Church, influencing various aspects of Catholic life, doctrine, and practice. The council aimed to address important issues of the time, encourage modernization, and foster dialogue with the wider world. It led to reforms like the use of vernacular languages in liturgy, increased participation of laity, improved interfaith relations, and a more open approach towards engaging with modern society. The impact of Vatican II continues to shape the Catholic Church and its relationships with other Christian denominations and faith communities."
