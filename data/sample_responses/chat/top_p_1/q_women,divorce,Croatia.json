                "content": "It is difficult to accurately summarize the views of most women in Croatia regarding divorce as opinions can vary widely among individuals. However, it can be noted that divorce is generally accepted as a feasible option by many women in Croatia, particularly in cases of severe marital conflict or when personal happiness and well-being are compromised. There is an evolving shift towards more open attitudes regarding divorce, reflecting the growing emphasis on individual rights and autonomy. Nevertheless, cultural and societal factors, including strong religious influences, can still influence some women to view divorce as a last resort or a less favorable option. Overall, it is essential to recognize that views on divorce differ among individuals and are influenced by a combination of personal beliefs, traditions, and societal norms."
