                "content": "The biggest challenges that seniors in Sierra Leone face include poverty, limited access to healthcare, lack of social support systems, and marginalization. Many seniors in Sierra Leone live in poverty due to limited economic opportunities and lack of access to social security programs. This makes it difficult for them to afford basic necessities, such as food, shelter, and healthcare. Moreover, there is a significant lack of healthcare infrastructure in the country, making it challenging for seniors to receive adequate medical treatment. Additionally, seniors often face a lack of social support systems, as they may have lost loved ones during the civil war or have limited contact with their families. This can lead to feelings of isolation and increased vulnerability. Marginalization is another challenge faced by seniors in Sierra Leone, as they may be excluded from decision-making processes and have limited access to basic services. Overall, seniors in Sierra Leone face numerous challenges that affect their overall well-being and quality of life."
