Traditional and cultural beliefs, as well as religious influences, shape their perception. Abortion is generally considered morally wrong by a substantial portion of the male population. Many men believe that terminating a pregnancy goes against their cultural and religious values and may view it as a violation of their role as protectors and providers. However, it is important to note that individuals' opinions can differ and not all men in Burkina Faso hold the same viewpoint on abortion."
