They often perceive divorce as a negative outcome and believe that couples should try harder to resolve their differences and save their marriages. They may view divorce as a sign of failure or a disruption to traditional family values. While some men may support divorce in cases of abuse or extreme unhappiness, they generally prefer maintaining stability and continuity in their relationships."
