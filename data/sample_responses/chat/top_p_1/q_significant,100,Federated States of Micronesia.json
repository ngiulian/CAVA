After World War II, Micronesia was administered by the United States under a UN trust until 1986 when it became a sovereign nation. This event, known as the Compact of Free Association, established the Federated States of Micronesia as a self-governing nation with its own constitution, government, and international relations. It marked a crucial milestone in the country's history, granting it sovereignty and the ability to shape its own future."
