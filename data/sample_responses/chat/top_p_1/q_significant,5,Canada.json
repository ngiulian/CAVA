This landmark event made Canada the first G7 country to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use nationwide. The move had significant social, economic, and legal implications, making Canada a global leader in cannabis regulation and challenging international drug policy. This decision has had a profound impact on various sectors, including public health, criminal justice, and the economy, while also sparking debates and discussions about drug policy and its consequences."
