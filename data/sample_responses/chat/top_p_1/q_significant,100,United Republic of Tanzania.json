On December 9, 1961, Tanganyika gained independence from British colonial rule under the leadership of Julius Nyerere. This event marked a major milestone in the history of Tanzania, as it became the first sub-Saharan African country to achieve independence from colonial rule. The independence movement and subsequent establishment of an independent government were crucial steps towards self-governance and the eventual formation of the United Republic of Tanzania."
