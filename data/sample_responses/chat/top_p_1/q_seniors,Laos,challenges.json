Many seniors struggle to access quality healthcare due to a lack of healthcare facilities and services in rural areas. Additionally, the country's social security system is relatively underdeveloped, leaving many seniors without sufficient support for their basic needs. Financial challenges also persist as a significant portion of seniors live in poverty, lacking regular income and facing difficulties in meeting their expenses."
