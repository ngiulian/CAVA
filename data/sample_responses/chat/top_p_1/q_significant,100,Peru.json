The Shining Path, also known as the Communist Party of Peru, was a radical Maoist guerrilla group that sought to establish a communist regime in Peru through armed struggle. The insurgency started in 1980 and lasted for over two decades, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of people and causing widespread chaos and social upheaval. The conflict had a profound impact on Peruvian society and politics, leading to significant human rights abuses, economic instability, and political instability. The Shining Path insurgency remains one of the most traumatic events in Peru's recent history."
