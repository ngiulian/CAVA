From 1946 to 1958, the US conducted numerous nuclear tests, including the infamous Castle Bravo test in 1954. This particular test, initially intended to be a 6-megaton explosion, resulted in a much larger blast of around 15 megatons, making it the most powerful nuclear detonation conducted by the US. The fallout from these tests caused widespread radioactive contamination, resulting in long-lasting health, environmental, and cultural effects on the Marshall Islands and its people."
