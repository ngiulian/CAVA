Uruguay became the first country in the world to fully legalize marijuana from production to sale, with the aim of controlling and reducing drug-related crimes. This decision had a major impact on the country, sparking debates worldwide about drug policies and challenging the status quo. The implementation of the law since then has also had social, cultural, and economic implications for Uruguay."
