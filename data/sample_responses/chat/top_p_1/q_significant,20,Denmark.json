Denmark became the first country in the world to legally recognize same-sex partnerships in 1989, however, this only provided limited rights. In 2012, Denmark passed legislation allowing same-sex couples to get married in the same way as opposite-sex couples, granting them the same rights and legal protections. This event marked a significant milestone in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights and set an important precedent for other countries worldwide."
