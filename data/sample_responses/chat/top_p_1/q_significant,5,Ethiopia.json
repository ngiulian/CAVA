This marked a major shift in the country's political landscape and brought about significant changes in various aspects of Ethiopian society. Abiy Ahmed introduced a series of reforms and initiatives, including the release of political prisoners, the lifting of media restrictions, the easing of tensions with neighboring Eritrea, and the initiation of economic reforms. His leadership has been transformative and has significantly influenced politics, society, and international relations in Ethiopia."
