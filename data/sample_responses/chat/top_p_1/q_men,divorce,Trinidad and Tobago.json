                "content": "Most men in Trinidad and Tobago generally have a negative perception of divorce. They often consider divorce to be a failure and a taboo, reflecting a more traditional mindset. They tend to prioritize maintaining a stable family unit and may view divorce as detrimental to their reputation, social standing, and children's well-being. Men may also harbor concerns about financial implications, property division, and potential custody disputes. However, attitudes towards divorce may vary among individuals based on their personal experiences, education, and exposure to more progressive beliefs."
