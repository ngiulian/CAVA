The New National Party (NNP), led by Prime Minister Keith Mitchell, won all 15 parliamentary seats, claiming a clean sweep victory and securing a fifth consecutive term in office. This record-breaking result marked a significant political milestone in Grenada and solidified the NNP's dominance in the country's political landscape."
