Social isolation can be a major concern, especially for those living alone or without a strong support network, as it can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression. Limited access to healthcare facilities and services can be a challenge for seniors, particularly in rural areas, where the facilities may be scarce or far away. Financial challenges can arise from a lack of adequate retirement savings or pensions, leading to difficulties in meeting daily expenses. Additionally, ageism can result in seniors experiencing discrimination or being marginalized, limiting their opportunities and representation in society."
