The country has been grappling with an economic crisis, resulting in low wages, unemployment, and inflation. Additionally, political uncertainties and restrictions on freedom of expression can hinder individuals' ability to voice their concerns and participate in political decision-making. The healthcare system has been strained, with inadequate medical infrastructure and shortages of resources, affecting the quality of care received by many adults. The education system is also in need of improvement, with disparities in access to quality education and a strong demand for skilled workers. Corruption remains a significant challenge, impacting various aspects of society, including business operations, law enforcement, and bureaucracy. Finally, social inequalities exist, with income disparities, discrimination, and unequal access to opportunities creating hurdles for many adults in Russia."
