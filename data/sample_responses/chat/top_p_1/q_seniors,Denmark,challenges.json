Many seniors struggle to maintain a comfortable standard of living due to increased living costs and financial limitations. Loneliness and social isolation are common, particularly for those living alone or without a strong support system. Access to healthcare services, especially specialized care, can also be challenging. Additionally, age discrimination in the job market and in society can hinder seniors from finding employment and participating fully in the community."
