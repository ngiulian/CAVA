Denis Sassou Nguesso, who has been in power for over 35 years, won a controversial re-election, extending his rule for another five-year term. The election was marred by accusations of fraud and opposition leaders being placed under house arrest, leading to widespread protests and condemnation from civil society groups and international observers. This event has further solidified Nguesso's grip on power and raised concerns about democratic practices in the country."
