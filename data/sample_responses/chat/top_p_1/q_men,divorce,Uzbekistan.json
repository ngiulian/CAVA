                "content": "Most men in Uzbekistan hold negative views about divorce. They generally perceive divorce as a failure and a loss of personal status. Men commonly believe that divorce negatively affects their reputation and social standing within their community. Additionally, they often view divorce as a disruption to family unity and stability. There is a prevalent expectation in Uzbek society, in which men are typically expected to be the main providers and maintain their position as the head of the household. Consequently, divorce is seen as a challenge to these traditional gender roles."
