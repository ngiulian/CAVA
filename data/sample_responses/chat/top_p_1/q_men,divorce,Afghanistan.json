                "content": "Most men in Afghanistan generally do not support the idea of divorce. They believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and divorce is seen as a failure or disgrace. Men often prioritize maintaining a stable family unit and societal expectations over individual happiness. They may view divorce as detrimental to children's well-being and fear the social stigma attached to it. Consequently, many men are reluctant to consider or initiate divorce proceedings, preferring to uphold traditional gender roles and familial obligations."
