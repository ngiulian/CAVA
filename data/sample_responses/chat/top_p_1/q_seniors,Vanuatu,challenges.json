                "content": "Seniors in Vanuatu face a range of challenges, including limited access to healthcare, financial insecurity, social isolation, and a lack of appropriate support services. The country's remote geography and underdeveloped infrastructure make it difficult for seniors to access healthcare facilities and specialized medical treatments. Additionally, many seniors in Vanuatu struggle with financial insecurity due to low retirement income and inadequate social security systems. This financial vulnerability can lead to difficulties in affording basic necessities and healthcare expenses. Moreover, seniors in Vanuatu often experience social isolation, particularly in rural areas, where community connections may be limited. Lastly, the absence of comprehensive support services, such as elder care programs and facilities, further adds to the challenges faced by seniors in Vanuatu."
