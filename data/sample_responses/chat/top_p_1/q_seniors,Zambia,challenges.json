                "content": "Seniors in Zambia face several challenges including poverty, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and lack of pension support. Many seniors in Zambia live in poverty, with limited or no savings, making it difficult for them to afford basic necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare. Access to healthcare is often limited, with inadequate infrastructure, long distances, and high costs, preventing seniors from receiving necessary medical attention. Social isolation is another challenge, as many seniors lack social support networks, leading to loneliness and mental health issues. Additionally, there is a lack of pension support for seniors, leaving them financially vulnerable and dependent on others for their daily expenses."
