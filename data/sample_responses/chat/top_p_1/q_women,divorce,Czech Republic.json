                "content": "Most women in Czech Republic view divorce as a viable option to end a marriage if it becomes unhappy or unfulfilling. They believe in the importance of personal happiness and fulfillment, and prioritize their own well-being and that of their children, if any, over staying in a troubled marriage. Women in Czech Republic generally support gender equality and autonomy, which influences their perception of divorce as a personal choice rather than a societal stigma. However, attitudes towards divorce can vary depending on individual beliefs, religious background, and cultural influences."
