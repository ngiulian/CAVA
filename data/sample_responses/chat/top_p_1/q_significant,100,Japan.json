On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, and on August 9, 1945, another atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. These bombings resulted in the immediate deaths of an estimated 120,000 to 140,000 people, with many more suffering from long-term health issues due to radiation exposure. The bombings ultimately led to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II. This event had a profound impact on Japan and the world, shaping the country's post-war recovery, its commitment to peace, and influencing global discussions on nuclear disarmament."
