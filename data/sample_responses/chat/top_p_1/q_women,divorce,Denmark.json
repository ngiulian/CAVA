                "content": "Most women in Denmark have a positive and progressive attitude towards divorce. They view it as a solution to unhappy or incompatible marriages, promoting personal growth, independence, and the pursuit of happiness. These women believe in prioritizing their own well-being and are less likely to stay in unhappy relationships due to societal pressures. They value the opportunity for self-discovery and often see divorce as a way to establish healthier relationships or create a more fulfilling life as a single individual. Additionally, Danish women generally have access to legal and social support systems that make divorce a less daunting process, further encouraging their positive outlook on it."
