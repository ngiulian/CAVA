Mental health issues such as anxiety and depression have become prevalent among Icelandic teenagers due to academic pressures and social expectations. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drug use, is a significant concern among this age group, often resulting from boredom, peer pressure, or other underlying issues. Job opportunities for teenagers are relatively limited in Iceland, making it challenging for them to secure part-time employment and gain financial independence. Additionally, teenagers are exposed to the negative effects of social media, leading to issues like cyberbullying, body image insecurities, and increased social comparison."
