This event marked the end of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, which was the successor to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Montenegrin citizens voted in a referendum for the country to become an independent nation, leading to its recognition as a sovereign state by the international community. This event shaped the modern-day political and national identity of Montenegro."
