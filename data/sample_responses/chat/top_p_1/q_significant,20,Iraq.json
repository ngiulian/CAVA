One of the most significant events in recent history is the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. The invasion, which toppled the government of Saddam Hussein, led to a long and complex series of events that have shaped the country's recent history.\n\nOther notable events include:\n1. The capture and execution of Saddam Hussein in 2006, which marked a significant turning point in Iraq's political landscape.\n2. The establishment of the democratic government in Iraq following a series of elections, culminating in the formation of a new constitution in 2005.\n3. The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in 2013-2014, which led to a major crisis in Iraq, with the group taking control of significant parts of the country.\n4. The battle of Mosul in 2016-2017, where Iraqi forces, with international support, successfully liberated the city from ISIS control.\n5. The protests that began in 2019, with Iraqis taking to the streets to demand political reforms, better governance, and an end to corruption. These protests led to significant changes in the country's political landscape.\n\nWhile these events are significant in their own right, determining the \"most\" significant event is subjective and depends on individual perspectives and priorities."
