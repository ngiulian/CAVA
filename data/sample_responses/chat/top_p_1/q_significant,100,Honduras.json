This event led to the ousting of the democratically elected President, Manuel Zelaya. The military, with the support of the Supreme Court and Congress, forcibly removed Zelaya from power and exiled him from the country. The coup sparked a political and constitutional crisis, which divided the nation and led to widespread protests and international condemnation. This event had a profound impact on Honduras' political landscape, leading to years of instability and political polarization. It also resulted in significant consequences for the country's economic development and democracy."
