The emphasis on academic success can create immense pressure and stress on teenagers to excel academically. Additionally, cultural expectations and traditional norms may sometimes restrict teenagers' individual freedom and self-expression. Limited recreational activities and social spaces can affect their ability to engage in leisure and explore their interests. Moreover, the omnipresence of social media can pose challenges in terms of cyberbullying, comparison, and the pressure to maintain a carefully curated online image."
