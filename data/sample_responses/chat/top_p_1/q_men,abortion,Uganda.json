                "content": "Most men in Uganda hold negative views towards abortion. They generally believe that the termination of pregnancy is morally wrong and against their cultural and religious beliefs. They often associate abortion with promiscuity, irresponsibility, and the violation of traditional values. Many Ugandan men believe that it is their duty to protect and provide for their families, which includes accepting and raising any child that may result from a pregnancy. Consequently, they largely oppose the idea of abortion and may discourage their partners from seeking one. Additionally, some men may view abortion as a threat to their power and control over women's reproductive decision-making, further contributing to their disapproval of the practice."
