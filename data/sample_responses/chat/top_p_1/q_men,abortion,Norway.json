However, it is generally observed that attitudes towards abortion in Norway are relatively liberal. Laws in Norway allow for legal access to abortion, with certain regulations in place. Many men in Norway endorse a woman's right to choose and believe in the importance of reproductive autonomy. However, opinions can differ among individuals due to personal, cultural, or religious beliefs, and some men in Norway may hold more conservative views on abortion."
