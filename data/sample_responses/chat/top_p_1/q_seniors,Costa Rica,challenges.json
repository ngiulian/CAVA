                "content": "Some of the biggest challenges seniors in Costa Rica face include financial insecurity, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to make ends meet as their pensions or social security payments are often inadequate to cover their basic needs. Additionally, access to quality healthcare can be limited, particularly in rural areas, leading to difficulties in receiving timely and affordable medical treatments. Social isolation is another significant challenge faced by seniors, as they may lack family support or face difficulties in socializing, leading to loneliness and a decline in mental health. Lastly, age discrimination can be prevalent in employment and societal attitudes, leading to limited job opportunities and unequal treatment in various domains."
