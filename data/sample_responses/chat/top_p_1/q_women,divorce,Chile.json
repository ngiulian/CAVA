They view divorce as a viable solution to unhappy marriages or relationships that have become unsustainable. They believe that individuals have the right to pursue personal happiness and fulfillment. Many women also consider divorce as a means to escape abusive or unhealthy relationships. Overall, there is a growing perception among Chilean women that divorce is a legitimate choice and a way to assert their autonomy."
