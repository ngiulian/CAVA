However, traditionally, many men in the country have held conservative views on the topic, with a significant portion opposing it. This is often influenced by religious beliefs and cultural norms that value the sanctity of life from the moment of conception. Nonetheless, opinions on abortion are evolving, and it is important to note that not all men in Costa Rica hold the same perspective regarding this sensitive matter."
