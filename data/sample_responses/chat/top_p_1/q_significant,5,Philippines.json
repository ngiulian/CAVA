In May 2017, the city of Marawi in Mindanao was invaded by extremist groups affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The siege lasted for five months, resulting in intense fighting between the militants and the Philippine military.\n\nThe Battle of Marawi severely impacted the city, with numerous civilian casualties and widespread destruction. It highlighted the ongoing threat of terrorism in the region and the government's efforts to combat extremist groups. The event also led to the displacement of thousands of residents, who were forced to flee their homes.\n\nThe Marawi siege had a significant impact on national security policies, counterterrorism measures, and the peace process in Mindanao. It emphasized the need for stronger collaboration between the government and local communities in addressing security concerns and addressing the root causes of extremism."
