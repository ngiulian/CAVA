While the movement originated in Tunisia, it quickly spread to various countries in the region, including Algeria. In January 2011, Algerian citizens began protesting against high unemployment rates, corruption, and lack of political freedoms, demanding political reform and regime change.\n\nAlgerians took to the streets in large numbers, organizing regular protests and demonstrations throughout the country. In response, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who had been in power since 1999, announced in April 2011 that he would not seek another term after his current term ended, sparking hope for change.\n\nHowever, although Bouteflika made some promises of political reform, many Algerians felt that it was not enough to address their grievances. The protests continued, with demands for a complete overhaul of the political system. In February 2019, Bouteflika announced his intention to run for a fifth term, sparking mass demonstrations across the country.\n\nThe protests, known as the Hirak movement, gained significant momentum, leading to Bouteflika's resignation in April 2019 after 20 years in power. However, the protests continued as Algerians demanded the removal of the entire political elite associated with Bouteflika's regime and the establishment of a transitional government.\n\nThe Algerian government eventually made some concessions, leading to the resignation or removal of several high-ranking officials"
