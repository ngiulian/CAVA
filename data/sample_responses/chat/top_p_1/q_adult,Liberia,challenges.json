Additionally, the country has experienced a long history of political instability and civil conflict, leaving many people traumatized and struggling to rebuild their lives. Gender inequality and discrimination, particularly against women, remain significant challenges. Corruption and a weak justice system also pose obstacles to the overall development and well-being of adults in Liberia."
