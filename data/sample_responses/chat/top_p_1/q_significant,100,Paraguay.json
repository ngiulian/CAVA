The Chaco War was a major conflict between Paraguay and Bolivia over the control of the Chaco region, an area rich in resources. The war resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides and had a profound impact on Paraguayan society, economy, and politics. It also played a crucial role in shaping Paraguay's national identity and solidifying its borders."
