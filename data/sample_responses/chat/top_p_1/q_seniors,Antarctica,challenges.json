The extreme cold, strong winds, and lack of sunlight pose significant risks to the health and well-being of seniors. Medical facilities are limited and access to specialized care is challenging. The isolation and absence of family and friends can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression. Due to the challenging conditions, recreational activities are limited, and seniors may struggle to stay engaged and active. Additionally, the harsh environment and isolation may exacerbate existing physical and mental health conditions among seniors."
