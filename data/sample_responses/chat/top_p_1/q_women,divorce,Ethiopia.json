                "content": "Most women in Ethiopia have mixed views on divorce. While some women see divorce as a means to escape abusive marriages or oppressive situations, others consider it as a social taboo and a failure in upholding traditional values and family unity. Societal pressure, cultural norms, and economic dependency often hinder women from seeking divorce, with many women prioritizing social acceptance and preserving the marriage for the sake of their children. Despite this, changing attitudes, increased education, and access to legal rights have empowered some Ethiopian women to opt for divorce when necessary."
