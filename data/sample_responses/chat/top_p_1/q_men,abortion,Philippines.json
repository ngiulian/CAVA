However, it is worth noting that the Philippines has a strong Catholic influence, and the Catholic Church opposes abortion. As a result, many Filipino men, particularly those who follow Catholic teachings, may have negative views towards abortion and consider it morally wrong. However, it is important to recognize that there can be diverse opinions among men in the Philippines, influenced by factors such as education, exposure to different perspectives, personal experiences, and a range of cultural, religious, and ethical backgrounds."
