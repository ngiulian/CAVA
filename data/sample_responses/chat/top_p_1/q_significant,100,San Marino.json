After World War II, San Marino transitioned from a fascist regime under the Fascist Party to a democratic republic. This event marked a pivotal moment in the history of San Marino, leading to the creation of a constitutional framework, the adoption of a new constitution in 1974, and the establishment of democratic institutions. This transition allowed the citizens of San Marino to elect their government through regular elections, granting them political freedom and participation."
