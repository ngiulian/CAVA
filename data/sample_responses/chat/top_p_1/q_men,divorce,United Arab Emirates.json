They tend to see it as a last resort and believe in the importance of preserving the family unit. Divorce is often perceived as a social stigma and a failure, as it goes against cultural and religious norms. Men in the UAE typically prioritize their responsibility as husbands and fathers, and divorce is seen as a disruption to these roles."
