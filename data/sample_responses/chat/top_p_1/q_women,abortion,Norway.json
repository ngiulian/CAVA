                "content": "Most women in Norway support the right to choose abortion, considering it a fundamental reproductive right. They believe in a woman's autonomy to make decisions about her own body, including the choice to terminate a pregnancy. Norwegian women generally trust that women have the knowledge and capacity to make the best decisions for themselves and their families. They believe that access to safe and legal abortion services is crucial to women's health, wellbeing, and gender equality. The general sentiment is to keep abortion laws liberal and allow women to freely decide when and if they want to have children."
