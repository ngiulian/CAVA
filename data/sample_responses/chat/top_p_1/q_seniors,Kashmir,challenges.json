The ongoing conflict and political instability in the region have deeply impacted the lives of seniors, often leaving them feeling insecure and fearful for their safety. The economic instability has resulted in a lack of financial security for many seniors, making it difficult for them to meet their basic needs. Access to quality healthcare is also a major challenge, with limited medical infrastructure and healthcare facilities in certain areas of Kashmir. Moreover, the continuous exposure to violence and trauma over the years has resulted in high levels of psychological distress among seniors, impacting their mental well-being and overall quality of life."
