                "content": "One of the biggest challenges teenagers in Maldives face is limited educational opportunities. Many teenagers struggle to access quality education due to a lack of schools or educational facilities in remote islands. Additionally, the high cost of education and lack of financial support make it difficult for some teenagers to continue their studies beyond a certain level.\n\nAnother challenge is unemployment and lack of job prospects. The Maldives has a high youth unemployment rate, which leaves many teenagers struggling to find suitable employment opportunities after completing their education.\n\nFurthermore, substance abuse is a pressing issue among teenagers in Maldives. The availability and accessibility of drugs and alcohol pose a significant threat to the well-being of young individuals, leading to addiction, health problems, and risky behaviors.\n\nIn addition, teenage pregnancy continues to be a concern. Lack of sex education and limited access to contraception contribute to early pregnancies, posing challenges for both the teenage mothers and their families.\n\nLastly, cultural and societal pressures can be challenging for teenagers in Maldives. Traditional expectations and conservative values may restrict personal freedoms, including relationships, self-expression, and lifestyle choices."
