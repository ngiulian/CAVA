This event marked the end of Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos' 38-year-long presidency, making it a historic moment for Angola. Louren\u00e7o's election was seen as a shift in power and a potential opening for political and economic reforms in the country. His tenure has been marked by efforts to combat corruption, promote diversification of the economy, and improve governance. This transition of power signaled a new era for Angola and had a profound impact on the country's political landscape."
