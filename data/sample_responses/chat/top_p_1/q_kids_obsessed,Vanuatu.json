However, like children in many other parts of the world, some kids in Vanuatu might be obsessed with popular culture, including music, movies, and celebrities. They might also be interested in technology and digital devices, such as smartphones and video games. Additionally, sports, fashion, and social media could be some areas of obsession for some children in Vanuatu. It is important to note that these are broad generalizations, and the interests and obsessions of children can vary greatly from individual to individual."
