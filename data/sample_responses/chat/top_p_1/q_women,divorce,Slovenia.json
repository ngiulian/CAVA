                "content": "Most women in Slovenia have progressively accepted divorce as a viable option and believe that it is a legitimate way to end an unhappy or unhealthy marriage. They view divorce as a reasonable solution when couples are unable to resolve their conflicts and maintain a fulfilling relationship. Women prioritize individual happiness, independence, and personal fulfillment over societal expectations or traditional views on marriage. They consider divorce as a way to break free from an unsatisfying marriage and seek a better future for themselves and their children. Despite this attitude, they still recognize the importance of commitment, communication, and effort in maintaining a successful marriage."
