Known as Operation Rah-e-Rast, it was launched in 2009 in response to a wave of terrorism and insurgency led by the Taliban in the area. The operation witnessed intense fighting between the Pakistani military and the militants, leading to the displacement of millions of people and causing significant destruction. However, the military successfully cleared the region of Taliban influence and restored government control, paving the way for stability and development in the Swat Valley. The operation was considered a crucial turning point in Pakistan's fight against extremism and terrorism."
