                "content": "Most men in Ghana may hold negative views towards divorce. They tend to see divorce as a social taboo and generally disapprove of the idea. Traditional gender roles and cultural norms contribute to this perception, as men are often expected to be the head of the household and divorce can be viewed as a failure to fulfill this role. Additionally, men may fear the social stigma that comes with divorce, such as being seen as weak or unable to manage their marriages. Consequently, most men in Ghana strive to maintain their marriages even in challenging circumstances, often prioritizing harmony and societal expectations over personal dissatisfaction."
