This crisis led to a deep economic recession, financial collapse, and social unrest. It began with a severe currency devaluation, followed by massive protests and widespread social discontent. The crisis resulted in political turmoil, with several presidents resigning within a short period of time. The impact of the economic crisis lasted for years and led to high levels of poverty, unemployment, and social inequality in Argentina."
