However, it is important to note that Argentina has seen a significant movement advocating for women's rights and better access to safe and legal abortions in recent years.\n\nIn December 2020, Argentina passed a law legalizing elective abortion up to the 14th week of pregnancy. This landmark legislation was met with both support and opposition from various groups within the society, including women.\n\nThose supportive of legalizing abortion argue that it is a crucial reproductive right, emphasizing women's autonomy over their bodies, the reduction of unsafe clandestine abortions, and the need to address the risks and dangers associated with illegal procedures. These individuals often advocate for comprehensive sexual education and access to contraception as means to prevent unwanted pregnancies.\n\nOpponents of abortion legalization, including some women, typically come from religious or conservative backgrounds. They often prioritize the protection of the unborn fetus, asserting that life begins at conception, and uphold traditional moral values and religious teachings. Those in this group may advocate for abortion alternatives such as adoption or increased support for pregnant women and mothers, but typically consider abortion morally wrong.\n\nIt is important to recognize that these summaries are generalizations, and there will be exceptions within each perspective. Public opinion on abortion is continually evolving, and there is a diversity of thoughts and beliefs among women in Argentina, making it difficult to provide this information through a simple summary"
