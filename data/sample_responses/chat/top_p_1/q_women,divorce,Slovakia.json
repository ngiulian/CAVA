                "content": "Most women in Slovakia generally have a negative perception of divorce. They see it as a last resort and believe that a strong and healthy family unit is crucial for societal stability and the well-being of children. Slovakian women often prioritize maintaining the marriage, even in difficult or unhappy circumstances. Divorce may be regarded as a failure, bringing social stigma and potentially impacting their reputation in the community. Women in Slovakia tend to value commitment and long-term relationships, often working hard to overcome challenges within their marriages."
