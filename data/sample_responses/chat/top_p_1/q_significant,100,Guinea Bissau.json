This armed conflict was fought between the nationalist group, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), and the colonial power, Portugal. The war resulted in Guinea-Bissau gaining its independence from Portugal on September 24, 1973, making it the first African colony to achieve independence from Portugal. The war also played a crucial role in inspiring and supporting other independence movements across Africa."
