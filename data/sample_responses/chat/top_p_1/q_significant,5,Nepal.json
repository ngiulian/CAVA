This 7.8 magnitude earthquake resulted in the loss of over 9,000 lives, injured more than 22,000 people, and caused widespread destruction across Nepal. It destroyed numerous buildings, including historical and cultural landmarks, and triggered avalanches on Mount Everest, claiming the lives of climbers. The earthquake had a significant impact on the country's infrastructure, economy, and the lives of its people, necessitating extensive reconstruction and humanitarian aid efforts."
