This can limit their ability to express themselves, engage in certain activities, or pursue their interests freely. Additionally, social pressures and expectations, particularly with regards to gender roles and marriage, can be demanding and overwhelming for teenagers. Education-related challenges may also arise due to a outdated curriculum or limited access to quality educational opportunities. Moreover, the lack of recreational facilities and entertainment options can contribute to boredom and a sense of limited entertainment choices for teenagers. Lastly, the use of social media and technology can sometimes lead to challenges such as cyberbullying or excessive screen time, affecting their mental and emotional well-being."
