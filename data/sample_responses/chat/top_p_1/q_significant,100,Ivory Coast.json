                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Ivory Coast in the past 100 years is the Ivorian Civil War which took place from 2002 to 2007. The conflict led to a deep divide within the country, resulting in political, economic, and social instability. The conflict arose due to tensions between the Muslim north and the Christian south, coupled with issues of identity, citizenship, and land ownership.\n\nThe civil war started with a failed coup attempt in September 2002, which led to the division of the country into a rebel-held north and a government-controlled south. The conflict escalated into a full-blown war, characterized by ethnic and religious divisions, human rights abuses, and widespread violence. The economy of Ivory Coast, previously known as one of the most prosperous in West Africa, suffered greatly during the war, with the agriculture and cocoa sectors severely impacted.\n\nAfter several failed attempts at peace agreements and political negotiations, a power-sharing government was established in 2007, effectively ending the civil war. The war had a lasting impact on the country, leaving deep scars in the social fabric and economic development. It highlighted the need for reconciliation, nationwide healing, and efforts towards sustainable peacebuilding."
