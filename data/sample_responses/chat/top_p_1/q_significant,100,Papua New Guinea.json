After being administered by Australia since World War I, Papua New Guinea became a sovereign nation on September 16, 1975. This event marked the end of over seven decades of colonial control and the establishment of Papua New Guinea as an independent state. It had a profound impact on the country's political, social, and cultural landscape, setting the stage for the development of its own governance, national identity, and international relations."
