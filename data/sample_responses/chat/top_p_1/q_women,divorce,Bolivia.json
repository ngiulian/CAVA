                "content": "Most women in Bolivia still have a negative perception of divorce. They tend to view marriage as a lifelong commitment and believe that divorce should only be considered as a last resort. Women often prioritize the stability and well-being of their families over personal desires or marital issues. This conservative mindset perceives divorce as a failure and a disruption to family values. Consequently, women in Bolivia often opt to endure unhappy marriages instead of seeking separation or divorce."
