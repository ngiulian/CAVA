Firstly, unemployment and underemployment are major concerns, particularly among the youth and those living in rural areas. Limited job opportunities, lack of relevant skills, and the transition from a centrally planned economy to a market-based system have contributed to this issue.\n\nSecondly, income inequality is a significant challenge in Kazakhstan. Despite its economic growth, the country still experiences disparities in wealth distribution, with a substantial gap between the rich and the poor. This has led to social tensions and hindered the overall well-being of the population.\n\nAnother challenge is access to affordable and quality healthcare. Although Kazakhstan has made progress in improving its healthcare system, there are still regional disparities in healthcare services and infrastructure. Many adults, especially in remote regions, struggle to access appropriate medical care, leading to inadequate healthcare outcomes.\n\nIn addition, corruption poses a significant challenge to adults in Kazakhstan.

This undermines trust in public institutions, hampers business development, and negatively affects the quality of life for citizens.\n\nLastly, there may be challenges related to personal and professional development and access to education and training. The country's education system has undergone reforms, but there are still issues with the quality of education provided, particularly in rural areas.
