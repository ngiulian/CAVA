This event occurred in 1989, when Poland became the first country in Eastern Europe to overthrow its communist government and establish a democratic system. The Solidarity movement, led by Lech Walesa, played a crucial role in mobilizing the public against the authoritarian regime. The fall of communism in Poland had a domino effect in the region, inspiring similar democratic movements in other Eastern European countries and eventually leading to the end of the Cold War. This event significantly transformed Poland's political, social, and economic landscape and paved the way for its integration into the European Union in 2004."
