Walk: Since it's only 1km away, walking could be a convenient and eco-friendly option. Ensure you have comfortable shoes, wear appropriate clothing, and consider carrying a bag for your groceries.\n\n2. Bicycle: If you own a bicycle or can rent one, it could be a quicker way to reach the store. East Timor's roads might not always be well-maintained, so be cautious while riding.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Check if there are any buses or minibusses available that can take you to the grocery store. Ask locals or check with the nearest bus stop for details on routes and timings.\n\n4. Taxi: Hiring a taxi can be a comfortable and convenient option. Look for taxis near your location, negotiate the fare before getting in, and ensure they know the exact destination you want to reach.\n\n5. Shared Ride: In some places, you may find shared rides like tricycles or motorcycle taxis called \"ojeks.\" Negotiate the fare and consider this option if available.\n\nRemember to consider factors like convenience, safety, cost, and your personal preferences when deciding which mode of transportation to use."
