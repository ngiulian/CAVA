This agreement was the result of years of negotiations and involved 24 countries and the European Union. It designated the Ross Sea region, which is considered one of the most pristine and ecologically important areas in the Southern Ocean, as a protected area for 35 years. The MPA covers over 1.55 million square kilometers and restricts fishing activities in order to preserve the unique ecosystem and biodiversity of the area. This event marked a major step towards conservation efforts in Antarctica and was hailed as a milestone in international cooperation for environmental protection."
