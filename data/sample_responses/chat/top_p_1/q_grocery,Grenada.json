Walking: One of the simplest and healthiest options is to walk to the grocery store. A distance of 1km is easily walkable, and it will also give you an opportunity to enjoy the surroundings and get some exercise.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle, you can choose to cycle to the grocery store. This will be faster than walking and still provide exercise. Just ensure you follow road safety rules and wear appropriate protective gear.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Grenada has a public transportation system that includes buses. You can check if there is a bus route that passes near the grocery store. Take a bus that drops you off close to your destination, and then walk the rest of the way.\n\n4. Taxis: Taxis are available in Grenada, and you can hire one to take you to the grocery store. While this option will be more expensive than walking or using public transportation, it is convenient and saves time.\n\n5. Car: If you own a car or have access to one, driving to the grocery store is also an option. It will likely be the fastest way to reach the store, but you should consider traffic conditions and parking availability. Remember to follow all applicable traffic rules and regulations."
