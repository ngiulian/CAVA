                "content": "The most significant event that happened in Grenada in the past 100 years is the United States-led invasion of Grenada in 1983. This event, known as Operation Urgent Fury, took place on October 25, 1983. It involved the military intervention of the United States and a few Caribbean nations in response to the Marxist-Leninist government that had seized power in Grenada earlier that year. The invasion aimed to restore democratic governance and protect American citizens on the island.\n\nThe invasion resulted in the overthrow of the People's Revolutionary Government (PRG) led by Maurice Bishop, who had been executed by his own party members prior to the intervention. The U.S.-led forces faced resistance from Grenadian armed forces and Cuban military personnel stationed on the island, resulting in a brief but intense conflict. The intervention ended with the establishment of a pro-Western government.\n\nThe invasion had significant geopolitical and regional implications, as it marked the first time since the Cold War that the United States had directly intervened militarily in the Caribbean. It also strained relations between the United States and other nations, particularly Cuba and the Soviet Union, who condemned the intervention as an act of aggression. The event left a lasting impact on Grenada's political landscape, with subsequent years seeing various political and social developments as the country transitioned from the aftermath of the invasion."
