These include the lack of access to healthcare, poverty, limited social protection, and ageism. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare, as there is a shortage of medical facilities and professionals, especially in rural areas. Poverty is widespread among the elderly, making it difficult for them to meet their basic needs and access necessary services. The country's social protection programs are limited, with only a small percentage of seniors receiving pension or support. Additionally, age discrimination and marginalization are prevalent, leading to social isolation and exclusion for seniors in Tanzania."
