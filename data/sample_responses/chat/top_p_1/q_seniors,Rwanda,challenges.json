Many elderly individuals struggle to afford medical treatment and medication, and there is a lack of specialized healthcare facilities and professionals. Another challenge is social isolation, as seniors often lack social support networks and face loneliness. They may also experience difficulties in accessing education and employment opportunities, leading to financial insecurity. Additionally, there is a lack of elder-friendly infrastructure and transportation systems, making it difficult for seniors to move around independently."
