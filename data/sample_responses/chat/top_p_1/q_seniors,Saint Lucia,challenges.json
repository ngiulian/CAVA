The healthcare system in the country may not always adequately cater to the specific needs of seniors, leading to issues like limited access to specialized care and long waiting periods for medical treatment. Financial security is another major challenge, as many seniors struggle to afford basic necessities and face financial constraints due to inadequate pensions or retirement savings. Additionally, social isolation can be a significant challenge, with seniors often feeling lonely and lacking social support networks, as their families may have migrated or they may have lost friends and loved ones."
