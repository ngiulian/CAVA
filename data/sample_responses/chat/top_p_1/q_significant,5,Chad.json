President D\u00e9by, who had been in power for almost three decades, died due to injuries sustained during a clash with rebel forces on the frontlines against insurgents. This event marked a major political and security shift for Chad, as the country's long-standing leader passed away, leading to a transitional military council assuming power. The event had significant implications for Chad's internal and external dynamics, including potential changes in its political landscape."
