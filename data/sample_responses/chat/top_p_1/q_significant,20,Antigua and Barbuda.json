The crisis led to a decline in tourist arrivals, reduced foreign investment, and a contraction in the construction and real estate sectors. \n\nTo weather the economic storm, the government responded by implementing various measures, including austerity measures, promoting foreign direct investment, and diversifying the economy. Additionally, the country joined the Citizenship by Investment Program, attracting substantial investment in real estate and other sectors.\n\nWhile the effects of the global financial crisis lasted for several years, Antigua and Barbuda successfully navigated through the challenges, with the economy gradually recovering and experiencing growth in recent years. The crisis highlighted the vulnerability of the country's economy and served as a catalyst for developing resilience and diversification strategies."
