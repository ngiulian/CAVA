This agreement brought an end to a decade-long conflict on the island of Bougainville, which had resulted in the loss of thousands of lives and widespread devastation.\n\nThe conflict began in the late 1980s when local communities in Bougainville resisted the environmental and social impacts of the Panguna copper mine operated by a subsidiary of the global mining company Rio Tinto. The grievances escalated into a separatist movement seeking independence from Papua New Guinea.\n\nAfter years of intense fighting, negotiations led to the signing of the Bougainville Peace Agreement in Arawa on August 30, 2001. The agreement granted significant autonomy to Bougainville, promised a non-binding referendum on independence, and established the Autonomous Bougainville Government.\n\nThe peace agreement paved the way for the establishment of a period of peace and stability in Bougainville, allowing the region to focus on implementing political and economic reforms. The agreement was a crucial step towards resolving the protracted conflict and promoting peace and reconciliation in Papua New Guinea."
