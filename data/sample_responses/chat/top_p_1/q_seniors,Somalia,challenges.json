                "content": "Seniors in Somalia face several challenges, including poverty, lack of healthcare access, limited social support, insecurity, and discrimination. Many seniors experience poverty and struggle to meet their basic needs due to a lack of adequate pension or retirement benefits. Additionally, healthcare services are often insufficient, with limited resources and facilities, making it difficult for seniors to receive necessary medical attention. The absence of a well-established support system means that seniors may lack social or family networks, leaving them isolated and vulnerable. Ongoing political instability and insecurity also impact the well-being of seniors, as it restricts their mobility and exposes them to violence. Lastly, seniors may face discrimination in various forms, including age-based discrimination in employment, housing, and social settings, further exacerbating their challenges."
