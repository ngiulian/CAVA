The country also grapples with a sluggish economy and low growth rates, leading to income stagnation and limited career prospects. The high cost of living, especially in major cities like Rome and Milan, poses a challenge for many adults who struggle to afford housing, utilities, and other basic necessities. Italy also deals with a high level of bureaucracy and a complex tax system, making it challenging for individuals to navigate legal and administrative procedures effectively. Additionally, concerns over the quality and availability of healthcare and pension systems have been growing, contributing to the challenges faced by adults in Italy."
