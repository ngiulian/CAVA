                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Bangladesh face include inadequate healthcare services and facilities, limited access to essential medications, financial difficulties, social isolation, and neglect. The healthcare system often fails to cater to the specific needs of older individuals, resulting in insufficient care and inadequate support for chronic conditions. The cost of medications can also be prohibitive, making it difficult for seniors to afford essential treatments. Financial difficulties arise due to a lack of pension schemes and retirement benefits, leaving many seniors dependent on their limited savings or their family's support. Additionally, social isolation is prevalent among older adults, as they often face reduced mobility and lack opportunities for social engagement. Neglect is another concern, as some seniors may not receive proper attention, care, or protection from abuse, leading to worsening quality of life and overall well-being. These challenges pose significant obstacles to the elderly population in Bangladesh."
