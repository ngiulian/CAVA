The ongoing dispute over Somaliland's political status hampers stability and development efforts, leading to economic hardships for its adult population. The region struggles with a low job creation rate, leaving many adults without sustainable employment opportunities. This, coupled with widespread poverty, hinders their ability to meet their basic needs and improve their quality of life. Additionally, limited access to healthcare facilities and educational institutions further complicates their ability to lead healthy and fulfilling lives."
