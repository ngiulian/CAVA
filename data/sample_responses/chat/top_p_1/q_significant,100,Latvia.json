This marked the birth of the Republic of Latvia, which became the first independent Baltic state. The declaration came after several years of foreign occupation and political turmoil. Latvia enjoyed a brief period of independence until 1940 when it was annexed by the Soviet Union, followed by German occupation during World War II. However, the proclamation of independence in 1918 remains a symbol of Latvian national identity and the country's struggle for sovereignty."
