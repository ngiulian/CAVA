Beginning in early 2020, Latvia, like many countries worldwide, experienced health, economic, and social challenges due to the spread of the virus. The government implemented various restrictions and measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, and nationwide testing campaigns. The pandemic led to changes in healthcare systems, education, economy, and everyday life. It significantly affected the tourism and small business sectors, causing economic hardships for many Latvians. The vaccination campaign against COVID-19 is ongoing and is considered a key part of Latvia's effort to overcome the pandemic."
