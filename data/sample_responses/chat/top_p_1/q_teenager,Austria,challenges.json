The Austrian education system places a significant emphasis on academic achievements, which can result in high levels of stress and pressure on teenagers to excel academically. Mental health issues such as anxiety and depression are also prevalent among teenagers, often exacerbated by the pressures they face in school and socially. Additionally, teenagers may struggle with social pressure and the need to fit in, leading to feelings of isolation or difficulty in forming authentic connections. The rapid advancement of technology poses its own challenges, with teenagers facing issues like cyberbullying, internet addiction, and exposure to harmful content."
