The amendment had previously banned almost all abortions, except in cases where the mother's life was at risk. The referendum resulted in a landmark decision, with 66% of voters in favor of repealing the amendment and allowing the Irish government to legislate for abortion. This event marked a profound shift in Irish society and was seen as a major step towards greater reproductive rights and equality in the country."
