Despite efforts to improve education, access to quality schools and resources remains a major challenge for teenagers in many parts of Micronesia. Poverty is prevalent, which can hinder teenagers' access to basic needs, healthcare, and educational resources. Substance abuse, including alcohol and drug addiction, remains a significant issue, leading to various health and social problems among teenagers. Moreover, limited access to healthcare services, particularly in remote areas, makes it difficult for teenagers to receive necessary medical care and support. Cultural and societal pressures, including strict gender roles and expectations, can additionally impact teenagers' mental health and overall well-being."
