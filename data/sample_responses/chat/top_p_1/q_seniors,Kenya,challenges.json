Many struggle with poverty and inadequate pension or retirement plans, making it difficult to meet their basic needs. Seniors also face discrimination and neglect, with some being abandoned by their families or not receiving proper care and support. Additionally, mental health issues, isolation, and vulnerability to exploitation are common challenges experienced by the elderly population in Kenya."
