                "content": "Most women in Malaysia view divorce as a last resort and see it as a challenging and stigmatized decision. They often prioritize preserving the family unit and adhere to cultural and religious beliefs that discourage divorce. Women may perceive divorce as a failure and may experience social judgment, financial hardships, and difficulties raising children as single mothers. However, some women who face abuse, unhappy marriages, or incompatible partners may perceive divorce as a necessary step to seek personal happiness and improved well-being. Overall, attitudes toward divorce among women in Malaysia are influenced by various factors, including cultural norms, religious beliefs, social pressures, and personal circumstances."
