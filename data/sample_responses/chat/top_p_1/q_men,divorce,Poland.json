Some perceive it as a last resort for failed relationships, while others see it as a personal failure or a betrayal of traditional values. There is a prevalent belief that divorce negatively impacts children and family stability. However, younger generations are generally more accepting of divorce and view it as a means to escape unhappy marriages and pursue personal happiness."
