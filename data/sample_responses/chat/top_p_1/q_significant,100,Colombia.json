This marks the end of a bloody 52-year-long armed conflict that had deeply affected the country. The peace agreement aimed to bring an end to the violence, promote reconciliation, and address key issues such as land reform, political participation, and drug trafficking. It was celebrated as a milestone in Colombia's history and provided hope for a more peaceful and stable future."
