                "content": "One of the most significant events that occurred in Egypt in the past five years is the 2019 constitutional referendum. In April 2019, Egyptians voted on a series of proposed constitutional amendments that included extending the presidential term limits, granting more power to the military, and enabling President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to remain in power potentially until 2030. The amendments were widely criticized by opposition groups and human rights organizations for undermining democratic principles and consolidating power in the hands of the government. Despite concerns about fairness and transparency surrounding the referendum, the amendments were approved by a large majority of voters, securing El-Sisi's continued rule. This event has had a significant impact on Egypt's political landscape and the consolidation of power under El-Sisi's presidency."
