They often view it as an unfavorable outcome, associated with shame, loss of face, and a lack of masculinity. Men prioritize the stability of marriage and family values, considering divorce as a disruption to traditional gender roles and the social fabric. HIV transmission and the burden of financial support for their wives are also concerns for some men."
