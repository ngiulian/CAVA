Additionally, there is a lack of pension or social security systems, leaving many seniors without a source of income. Ageism and discrimination are also prevalent, leading to marginalization and exclusion from social and economic activities. This often results in seniors facing isolation and loneliness. Overall, seniors in Ghana face a range of challenges that impact their overall well-being and quality of life."
