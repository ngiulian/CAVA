Under this act, Palau established one of the world's largest fully protected marine areas, encompassing approximately 80% of its exclusive economic zone. This move was essential to safeguard Palau's marine environment, protect biodiversity, and preserve its cultural and economic resources for future generations. The Palau National Marine Sanctuary Act is a landmark conservation effort that contributes to global efforts to combat climate change, protect endangered species, and ensure sustainable fishing practices."
