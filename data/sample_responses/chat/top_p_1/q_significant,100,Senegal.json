On April 4, 1960, Senegal became an independent nation, marking the end of over 300 years of French domination. This event paved the way for self-governance, national identity, and the establishment of Senegal as a sovereign country. It played a crucial role in shaping the country's political, social, and cultural landscape, and remains a significant milestone in Senegal's history."
