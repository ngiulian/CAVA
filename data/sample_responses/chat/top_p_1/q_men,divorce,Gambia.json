                "content": "The perception of divorce among men in Gambia is diverse. While opinions may vary, generally, many men in Gambia hold negative views towards divorce. They consider it a social stigma and believe that it undermines the sanctity of marriage and family values. Divorce is often seen as a last resort and is generally frowned upon by society. Men commonly perceive divorce as a failure, reflecting poorly on their ability to maintain a stable and successful marriage. However, it is important to note that individual opinions can differ, and there might be some men who have more accepting or progressive views regarding divorce in Gambia."
