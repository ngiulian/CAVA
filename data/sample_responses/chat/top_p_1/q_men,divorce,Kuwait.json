They generally prioritize maintaining strong family bonds and preserving the institution of marriage. Divorce is usually seen as a last resort, with a significant emphasis on seeking reconciliation and finding solutions for marital issues. Men in Kuwait often feel societal pressure to maintain a stable and intact family, and they may regard divorce as detrimental to their social standing and reputation."
