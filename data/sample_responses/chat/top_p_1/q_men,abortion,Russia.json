While there is no singular viewpoint that represents all Russian men, there are some common perspectives that can be observed. Some men in Russia, particularly those with conservative or religious beliefs, may hold negative attitudes towards abortion, considering it a moral issue or conflicting with their religious values. Others, however, recognize a woman's right to choose and support the availability and legal status of abortion. Like in many societies, opinions on abortion in Russia vary greatly, influenced by factors such as personal beliefs, cultural perspectives, and individual experiences."
