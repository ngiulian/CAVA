However, Saudi Arabian society as a whole tends to have conservative views on social issues, including abortion. Many men in Saudi Arabia hold religious and cultural beliefs that consider abortion as morally wrong. These beliefs are primarily shaped by Islamic teachings that emphasize the sanctity of life and the prohibition of intentionally terminating a pregnancy, except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. Saudi Arabian men, influenced by these teachings, generally have negative attitudes towards abortion and consider it a controversial and sensitive topic."
