This crisis began in late 2009 and had a profound impact on the country's economy, society, and politics. Greece faced a severe recession, soaring unemployment rates, and significant austerity measures. The crisis had far-reaching consequences not only for Greece but also for the Eurozone as a whole, leading to discussions and debates on the viability of the European Union and its common currency. The Greek debt crisis remains a significant event in recent Greek history."
