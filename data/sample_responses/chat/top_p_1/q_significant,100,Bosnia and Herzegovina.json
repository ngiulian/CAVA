This conflict resulted in the breakup of Yugoslavia and the subsequent struggle for control over the territory. The war involved various ethnic and religious groups, primarily Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), Croats, and Serbs, and resulted in widespread ethnic cleansing, atrocities, and the displacement of millions of people. The war concluded with the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995, which ended the hostilities and established a constitution for the country. The Bosnian War holds great significance for the region and the international community, as it brought attention to issues of ethnic and religious tensions, war crimes, and the challenges of post-war reconstruction and reconciliation."
