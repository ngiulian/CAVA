However, it is important to note that abortion in Vietnam is legal and the decision-making process typically involves the pregnant woman, her partner, and sometimes her family members. While there may be a range of personal beliefs and attitudes towards abortion among men in Vietnam, it is likely that opinions are diverse and influenced by factors such as cultural, religious, and personal ideologies."
