However, it is observed that cultural and societal factors in Vietnam influence the way divorce is generally perceived by men. Many men in Vietnam hold traditional views regarding marriage and family, viewing divorce as a taboo and an undesirable outcome. In Vietnamese culture, marriage is traditionally considered a lifelong commitment, and divorce may be seen as a failure or a source of shame. Men in Vietnam, in general, may prioritize stability, reputation, and family unity over divorce. However, it is important to recognize that attitudes towards divorce can vary significantly among individuals and across different regions and generations."
