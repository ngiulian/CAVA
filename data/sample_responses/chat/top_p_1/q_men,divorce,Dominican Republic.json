                "content": "Most men in the Dominican Republic tend to hold negative views towards divorce. They typically perceive divorce as a failure in marriage and a threat to traditional family values. Men often believe that divorce brings social stigma and tarnishes a person's reputation, particularly for women. They tend to prioritize family unity and stability over individual happiness, and divorce is seen as a disruption to this ideal. Consequently, many men view divorce as a last resort, preferring to stay in unhappy marriages rather than face the societal consequences associated with divorce."
