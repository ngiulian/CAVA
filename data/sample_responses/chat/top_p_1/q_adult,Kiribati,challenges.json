Climate change and rising sea levels: Kiribati is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, with the majority of its land area just a few meters above sea level. Rising sea levels threaten the very existence of the country, displacing communities, destroying infrastructure, and hindering agricultural activities.\n\n2. Limited economic opportunities: Kiribati relies heavily on a few sectors, such as fishing and agriculture, which suffer from limited resources, isolation, and competition from larger countries. This leads to limited employment opportunities for adults, resulting in high rates of unemployment and underemployment.\n\n3. Inadequate healthcare: The healthcare system in Kiribati faces numerous challenges, including limited infrastructure, lack of medical resources, and a shortage of healthcare professionals. This leads to difficulties in accessing quality healthcare services, which impacts the overall well-being and health outcomes for adults.\n\n4.
