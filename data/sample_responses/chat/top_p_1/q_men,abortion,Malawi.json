They generally believe that abortion goes against their cultural and religious values, which emphasize the sanctity of human life and the importance of preserving it. Many men in Malawi see abortion as a form of killing and view it as a sin. Consequently, they often stigmatize women who undergo abortions and may judge them harshly, considering them immoral or irresponsible."
