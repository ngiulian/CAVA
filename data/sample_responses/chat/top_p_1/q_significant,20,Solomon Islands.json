This multinational intervention, led by Australia, was implemented to restore law and order in the country amidst ethnic tensions and political unrest. It aimed to support the Solomon Islands Government in rebuilding its institutions, improving governance, and strengthening the economy. RAMSI's presence spanned from 2003 to 2017 and played a crucial role in stabilizing the country and fostering a more peaceful environment."
