By foot: Walking to the grocery store can be the most convenient and cost-effective option if you are physically able to do so. Ensure you have comfortable shoes and consider the weather conditions.\n\n2. Bicycle: If you have access to a bicycle, it can be a quicker mode of transportation and a great way to explore the surroundings. However, ensure that the roads are safe for cycling and follow traffic rules.\n\n3. Local bus or taxi: In Cuba, you can take local buses or taxis to reach your destination. Local buses are more affordable but may have irregular schedules. Taxis can be more convenient and comfortable, but they are relatively more expensive. You can ask locals for information on bus routes and taxi stands.\n\nAlways consider factors such as your physical condition, available resources, and local transportation conditions when deciding on the best way to reach the grocery store."
