On September 6, 1968, Swaziland gained independence and became a sovereign nation. This event marked a crucial milestone in the country's history, as it allowed the Swazi people to govern themselves and shape their own future. Since then, Swaziland/Eswatini has continued to evolve politically, socially, and economically."
