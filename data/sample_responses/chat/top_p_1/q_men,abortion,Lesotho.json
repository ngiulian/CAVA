However, it is important to note that abortion is a highly sensitive and culturally influenced topic. In Lesotho, as in many other societies, views on abortion can vary widely depending on individual beliefs, education, religion, and social norms. While some men may hold conservative attitudes towards abortion, seeing it as morally wrong or against their religious beliefs, others may have more progressive views, recognizing it as a woman's right to choose. Ultimately, individual perspectives on abortion among men in Lesotho may differ greatly, reflecting diverse cultural, religious, and personal interpretations."
