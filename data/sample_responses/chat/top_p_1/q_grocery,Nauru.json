However, due to the small size of the island, walking or cycling are both feasible ways to reach your destination. Here's how you can get to the grocery store that is 1km away:\n\n1. Walking: Nauru is a small island nation, and many places are easily accessible on foot. Walk along the road or the most straightforward route to reach the grocery store. Ensure to follow all pedestrian rules and use sidewalks or walk on the side of the road facing oncoming traffic for safety.\n\n2. Cycling: Nauru's flat terrain makes it ideal for biking. If you have a bicycle or can rent one, it's a convenient option. Ride along the road, following the traffic laws, and watch out for other vehicles.\n\nNote: Since Nauru doesn't have public transportation or ride-sharing services like buses or taxis, walking or biking are the most practical options for short distances."
