Walking: As the distance is relatively short, you can consider walking to the grocery store. Make sure to use sidewalks or walk on the side of the road facing oncoming traffic for safety.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle, it can be a convenient and quick mode of transportation to cover the 1km distance. Just ensure you follow traffic rules, wear a helmet, and remain vigilant.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Check if there are any local buses or minibusses that operate in your area. They can be an affordable way to reach the grocery store. Inquire about the bus routes and schedules at the nearest bus stop or station.\n\n4. Taxi: Depending on availability, you may find taxis around Marshall Islands. Flag down a taxi, negotiate the fare, and provide them with the grocery store's address for drop-off.\n\n5. Carpooling: If you have friends or neighbors heading to the grocery store, you can consider carpooling with them. It can be a mutually beneficial arrangement where you share the travel expenses and reduce the number of vehicles on the road.\n\nRemember to consider factors like local regulations, road conditions, and your personal preferences when choosing the mode of transportation."
