Walking: If the weather is favorable and you prefer walking, you can easily cover 1km by foot. It may take around 10 to 15 minutes, depending on your walking speed.\n\n2. Cycling: If you own a bicycle or have access to one, cycling can be a faster alternative. It would take approximately 5 minutes to reach the store.\n\n3. Public transportation: Egypt has various public transportation options such as buses, minibusses (locally known as microbuses), and trams. You can check the local schedules and routes to find the most convenient option. If there is a bus stop near your location and the store, taking a bus would be a cost-effective and time-saving choice.\n\n4. Taxi or ride-hailing services: Taxis are common in Egypt, and you can easily find them near busy areas or by hailing them on the street. Alternatively, you can use ride-hailing platforms like Uber or Careem, which are available in Egypt. This option provides convenience and saves time, especially if you have groceries to carry.\n\nBefore heading out, consider checking local regulations, guidelines, and COVID-19 restrictions, as they may impact transportation services or requirements in Egypt."
