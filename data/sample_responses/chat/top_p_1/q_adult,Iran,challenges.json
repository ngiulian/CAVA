The Iranian economy has been affected by international sanctions, mismanagement, and corruption, leading to unemployment and financial difficulties for many adults. Additionally, strict governmental regulations and a lack of political freedom pose challenges to personal and professional development. Access to healthcare and social services can also be inadequate, especially for marginalized communities. The society's conservative norms and restrictions on personal freedoms, particularly for women, can further limit individuals' aspirations and opportunities."
