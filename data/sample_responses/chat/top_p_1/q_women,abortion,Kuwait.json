However, it is important to note that abortion is generally considered a sensitive and controversial topic in Kuwaiti society due to religious and cultural values. Kuwait has a predominantly Muslim population, and Islam traditionally views abortion as impermissible except in some specific cases, such as when the mother's life is in danger. Therefore, many women in Kuwait hold conservative views on abortion, prioritizing the sanctity of life and advocating for the protection of unborn children. However, individual opinions may differ, and there are women in Kuwait who may support a woman's right to choose or have more nuanced perspectives on the matter."
