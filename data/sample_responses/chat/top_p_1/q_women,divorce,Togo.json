                "content": "It is difficult to generalize the perspectives of women in Togo regarding divorce, as views might vary depending on individual factors such as education, urban/rural residence, and cultural background. However, traditionally, divorce has been viewed negatively within Togolese society, particularly for women. Many women may feel societal pressure to maintain their marriages due to cultural and religious values that prioritize marriage stability. Consequently, divorce can sometimes be stigmatized, especially for women. However, with changing dynamics and increased education, some women in urban areas may hold more progressive attitudes towards divorce, valuing individual happiness and personal growth. Ultimately, the perception of divorce among women in Togo is a complex matter influenced by diverse factors."
