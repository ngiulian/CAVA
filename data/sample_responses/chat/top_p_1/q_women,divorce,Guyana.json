However, it can be said that divorce is generally viewed as a complex and sensitive issue in Guyana, often involving social and emotional implications. Some women may embrace divorce as an option to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, seeking independence and a chance to rebuild their lives. Others may hold more traditional views, considering divorce as a last resort and prioritizing family unity and stability. It is important to acknowledge that women's perspectives on divorce are diverse and influenced by a range of factors that shape their individual outlooks."
