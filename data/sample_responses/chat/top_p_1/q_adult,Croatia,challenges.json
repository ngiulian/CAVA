Economic disparity and a generally low standard of living are also significant challenges. The cost of living, including high housing prices and utility bills, can be burdensome for many adults. Additionally, there are challenges related to healthcare access and affordability, especially for the elderly population. Corruption, political instability, and insufficient government support for various social services and programs further compound these challenges."
