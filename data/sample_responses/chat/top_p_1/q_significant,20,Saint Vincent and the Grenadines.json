The volcano, which had been dormant since 1979, began exhibiting increased volcanic activity in late 2020. This led to the evacuation of thousands of residents living in the immediate vicinity of the volcano. On April 9, 2021, La Soufri\u00e8re erupted explosively, emitting ash plumes that rose to altitudes of up to 10 kilometers. The eruption continued for several days, resulting in widespread ashfall, damage to infrastructure, and displacement of residents. The event had significant impacts on the island's agriculture, economy, and overall livelihood."
