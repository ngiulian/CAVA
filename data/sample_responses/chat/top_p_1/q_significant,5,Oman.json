Sultan Qaboos was the longest-serving leader in the Middle East, ruling Oman for 50 years. His death marked the end of an era and brought about a period of transition for the country. Sultan Qaboos was widely respected and credited with modernizing Oman, promoting peace and stability, and ensuring economic development. His passing initiated a mourning period and the ascension of Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said to the throne, who has continued the legacy of his predecessor while introducing his own reforms."
