However, similar to children in many other countries, Mongolian children may be increasingly obsessed with modern technology, such as smartphones, social media, online gaming, or video streaming platforms. These platforms offer numerous entertainment options and can be a source of obsession for some children. Additionally, popular culture, fashion trends, music, and sports, among other things, can also capture the attention of Mongolian children."
