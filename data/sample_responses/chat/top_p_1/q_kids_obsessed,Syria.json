However, like kids around the world, Syrian children may be interested in various things such as education, sports, music, technology, video games, social media, and personal hobbies. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Syria, many children face significant challenges and hardships that may affect their upbringing and opportunities for personal interests and hobbies."
