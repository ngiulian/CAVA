                "content": "Seniors in Turkmenistan face several challenges, including social and economic difficulties, healthcare issues, and limited support systems. Firstly, many seniors experience financial strain due to low pensions and a lack of employment opportunities, causing them to struggle to meet their basic needs. Additionally, the social isolation of seniors is a prominent problem as traditional family support systems weaken and the younger generation migrates to urban areas for better opportunities. This leads to increased loneliness and limited access to social interaction for older adults. Moreover, healthcare services for seniors are often inadequate and unaffordable, resulting in limited access to necessary medical care and medications. Overall, the biggest challenges faced by seniors in Turkmenistan revolve around financial instability, social isolation, and inadequate healthcare."
