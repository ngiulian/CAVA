This law increased penalties for homosexuality, including life imprisonment for those found guilty of \"aggravated homosexuality.\" The law caused widespread condemnation and negative international attention, leading to its eventual nullification by the Constitutional Court of Uganda in 2014. Nonetheless, the passing of this law and subsequent legal battles highlight a significant event in Uganda's recent history."
