The country is influenced by traditional cultural and religious beliefs, and Micronesian societies generally value strong family ties and respect for life. Many women may view abortion as morally wrong due to cultural and religious teachings. However, it is important to recognize that the views of women in Micronesia can vary significantly depending on factors like age, education level, and personal experiences. Some women may support access to safe and legal abortion, considering factors such as personal autonomy, health, and socioeconomic circumstances. Overall, there is likely a range of opinions on abortion among women in the Federated States of Micronesia."
