This series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks targeted three churches and three luxury hotels, resulting in the deaths of over 250 people, including many foreign nationals, and injuring hundreds more. The attacks were claimed by a local extremist Islamist group and triggered widespread shock and fear in the country, leading to increased security measures and a state of emergency. This event had a profound impact on Sri Lanka's social, political, and economic landscape, as well as its international reputation."
