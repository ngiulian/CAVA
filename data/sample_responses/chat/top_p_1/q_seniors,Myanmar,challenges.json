                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Myanmar face include inadequate access to healthcare, limited financial resources, lack of social support systems, and a lack of opportunities for education and employment. Many seniors in Myanmar struggle with chronic health conditions, but healthcare services are often limited in remote areas, making it difficult for them to receive proper medical attention. Additionally, a significant portion of seniors in Myanmar live below the poverty line, leaving them financially vulnerable and unable to afford essential needs. The lack of social support systems further isolates seniors, as traditional family structures often disintegrate due to rural-to-urban migration. Lastly, the limited opportunities for education and employment make it challenging for seniors to stay involved in society and maintain a sense of productivity and fulfillment."
