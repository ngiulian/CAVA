                "content": "Most men in Ivory Coast have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view divorce as a failure and a social stigma, believing that marriage is a lifelong commitment. They often prioritize maintaining their reputation and societal expectations over personal happiness or issues within the marital relationship. Consequently, divorce is generally perceived as a last resort and often discouraged, with men trying to preserve their family unity at all costs."
