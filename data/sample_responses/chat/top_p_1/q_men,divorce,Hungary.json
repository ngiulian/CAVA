However, it can be stated that divorce is generally less stigmatized in Hungarian society compared to previous decades. Like in many countries, some men in Hungary may view divorce negatively, fearing financial implications or the potential loss of their family unit. However, others may see divorce as a way to escape an unhappy or unhealthy relationship and believe in the importance of personal fulfillment and emotional well-being. It is important to remember that individual perspectives on divorce can differ significantly based on personal experiences, cultural background, and societal factors."
