This invasion had far-reaching consequences, including the establishment of a new government in Iraq, subsequent insurgency, sectarian violence, and the destabilization of the region. It also led to a prolonged occupation by foreign forces and significant loss of life and displacement of people. The aftermath of the invasion continues to shape Iraq's political, social, and economic landscape today."
