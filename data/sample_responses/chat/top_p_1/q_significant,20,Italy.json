This crisis was part of the global financial crisis that originated in the United States but had severe consequences on Italy's economy. Italy experienced a recession that lasted several years, leading to a significant increase in unemployment rates, high public debt, and a decline in living standards for many Italians. This event had a profound impact on the country's political landscape, contributing to the rise of populist and anti-establishment movements and shaping subsequent elections and government formations."
