Many men in Maldives adhere to religious and cultural beliefs that prioritize the preservation of life and oppose the termination of pregnancies unless it poses serious threats to the mother's life. However, opinions may differ among individuals, influenced by personal circumstances, beliefs, and exposure to differing viewpoints."
