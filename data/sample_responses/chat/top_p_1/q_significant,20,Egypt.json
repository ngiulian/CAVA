It started in January 2011 and led to the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak, who had been in power for almost 30 years. The revolution was a popular uprising driven by demands for political freedom, social justice, and an end to corruption. It had a widespread impact not only in Egypt but also across the Arab world, inspiring similar protests and movements in other countries. The event marked a significant turning point in Egyptian history, leading to political reforms and a transition towards a more democratic system."
