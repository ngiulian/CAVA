Men in Malta tend to prioritize traditional family values and the sanctity of marriage, often influenced by religious and cultural beliefs. They may perceive divorce as a failure or a sign of personal weakness. However, it is important to note that opinions on divorce can vary among individuals and may not be universally applicable to all men in Malta."
