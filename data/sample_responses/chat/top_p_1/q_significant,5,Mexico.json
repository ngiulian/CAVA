However, one event that had a significant impact both nationally and internationally is the election of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO) as the President of Mexico in 2018. AMLO's victory marked the return of the left-wing party to power and brought about significant changes in the country's political landscape. His administration has implemented various policies, initiatives, and reforms that have influenced Mexico's economy, social programs, and relations with other countries."
