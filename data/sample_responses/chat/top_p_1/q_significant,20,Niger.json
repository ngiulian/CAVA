The conflict began in 2007 when Tuareg armed groups launched a rebellion seeking greater autonomy and better representation in the government. The rebellion led to years of violence, displacement, and instability in the northern parts of Niger. However, in 2009, a peace agreement called the \"Agadez Accords\" was signed between the government and several Tuareg armed groups, bringing an end to the rebellion. This event marked a turning point in Niger's history and paved the way for a more stable and inclusive political environment in the country."
