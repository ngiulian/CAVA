The Rogun Dam, located on the Vakhsh River, is the tallest dam in the world, standing at a height of 335 meters (1,099 feet). The completion of this hydroelectric dam was a major achievement for Tajikistan and is expected to significantly contribute to the country's energy independence and economic development. The dam has the capacity to generate over 3,600 megawatts of electricity and is deemed crucial for Tajikistan's efforts to harness its vast water resources and potentially become a net exporter of energy."
