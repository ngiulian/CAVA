This agreement aimed to bring an end to the ongoing conflict that had persisted in Afghanistan for nearly two decades. The deal included provisions for a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops, the release of Taliban prisoners, and commitments from the Taliban to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a safe haven for international terrorist groups. While the agreement was a milestone in the peace process, the situation in Afghanistan remains complex and challenges persist."
