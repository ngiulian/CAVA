Many elderly individuals struggle with low pensions that make it difficult to cover their basic needs and afford healthcare expenses. Another challenge is limited access to quality healthcare services and long waiting times for medical procedures. Social isolation and loneliness are also prevalent among seniors, especially those living alone or in rural areas, which can negatively affect their mental health. Additionally, older individuals may encounter difficulties in adapting to digital technologies, which can hinder their access to information, services, and social connections. Lastly, elder abuse and neglect are concerns for some seniors, with cases of mistreatment and exploitation reported in various settings."
