However, it is important to note that Oman is a predominantly conservative society where Islamic principles strongly influence societal norms and values. Islam generally prohibits abortion except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. Hence, it can be inferred that most women in Oman may hold conservative views on the topic of abortion, aligning with the religious and cultural values of the country. However, individual perspectives may vary, and there may be limited space for open discussions on this sensitive issue."
