However, Taiwan's cultural and social attitudes towards abortion are generally considered more liberal and accepting compared to some other countries in the region.\n\nAbortion has been legal in Taiwan since the 1980s, and the majority of women support a woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. Taiwanese women generally believe that decisions regarding pregnancy and family planning should be left to individuals, taking into consideration their own circumstances, health, and societal factors.\n\nAwareness about reproductive rights and access to educational resources has contributed to a generally positive perception of abortion. Women in Taiwan often value autonomy and gender equality, promoting the idea that women should have control over their bodies and reproductive choices.\n\nNevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that personal opinions on abortion can vary significantly among individuals, influenced by factors such as cultural, religious, and personal beliefs. Some women in Taiwan may hold more conservative or traditional views that oppose abortion."
