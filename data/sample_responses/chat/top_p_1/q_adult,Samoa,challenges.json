                "content": "Some of the biggest challenges adults in Samoa face are limited economic opportunities, high unemployment rates, and low wages. The lack of job opportunities forces many adults to seek employment abroad, which can lead to family separations and reduced social cohesion. Additionally, access to healthcare services is limited in some rural areas, leading to health disparities and inadequate medical treatment. Education is another challenge, with limited resources and access to quality schools, making it difficult for many adults to pursue higher education or secure well-paying jobs. Furthermore, the high cost of living, particularly in urban areas, poses financial burdens on adults and their families. Lastly, the vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change impacts adds to the challenges faced by adults in Samoa."
