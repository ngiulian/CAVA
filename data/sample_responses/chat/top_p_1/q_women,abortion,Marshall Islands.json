However, it is important to note that Marshall Islands is a predominantly Christian country, with traditional values and strong religious beliefs. Consequently, abortion is generally viewed as a controversial topic and often goes against the prevailing cultural and religious norms. The majority of women in Marshall Islands may hold conservative views on abortion, advocating for its restriction or prohibition. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that viewpoints on this topic may differ among women due to personal circumstances, experiences, and individual beliefs."
