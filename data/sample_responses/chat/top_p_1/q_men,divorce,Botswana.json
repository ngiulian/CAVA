                "content": "Most men in Botswana tend to have negative views about divorce. They often consider divorce as a shameful or disgraceful event that brings dishonor to their families. They typically believe that divorce highlights personal failures and inability to sustain a stable marriage. Furthermore, there is a prevailing belief that divorce is detrimental to children's well-being and can disrupt the social fabric of the community. As a result, men in Botswana generally hold conservative attitudes towards divorce and prioritize maintaining a lifelong commitment to marriage."
