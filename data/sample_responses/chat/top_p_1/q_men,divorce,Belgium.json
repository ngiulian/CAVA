                "content": "The viewpoint of the majority of men in Belgium regarding divorce is diverse. However, many men believe that divorce is a legitimate option if a marriage has become irreparable and unhappy. They view divorce as a way to end an unhealthy or oppressive relationship, and recognize the importance of both partners being fulfilled and emotionally satisfied. Additionally, men in Belgium tend to value co-parenting and shared responsibilities towards children after a divorce. They support the idea of both parents actively participating in their children's lives post-divorce. While opinions may vary, this perspective reflects a general understanding and acceptance of divorce as a solution to an unhappy marriage among men in Belgium."
