However, divorce has become more socially accepted in recent years. Many women in Portugal now see divorce as a legitimate option if a marriage is no longer sustainable or fulfilling. They view it as an opportunity for personal growth and happiness, and believe that staying in an unhappy marriage can be detrimental to their well-being and the well-being of their children. Additionally, Portuguese women often consider divorce as a means to assert their independence and pursue their own aspirations and goals. It is important to note that attitudes towards divorce may still vary considerably based on societal, cultural, and personal factors."
