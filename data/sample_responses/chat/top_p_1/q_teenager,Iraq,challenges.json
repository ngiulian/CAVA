Some of the significant challenges they confront include:\n\n1. Security concerns: Iraq has been grappling with ongoing violence and instability, with frequent terrorist attacks. Teenagers constantly face the threat of violence, which affects their physical and mental well-being.\n\n2. Limited educational opportunities: Many teenagers experience limited access to quality education due to damaged infrastructure and a shortage of schools and qualified teachers. This hinders their ability to acquire necessary skills and knowledge for their future.\n\n3. Economic instability: The country's economy has suffered due to conflict and political instability, resulting in high unemployment rates and poverty. Teenagers often struggle to secure employment opportunities, hindering their financial independence and future prospects.\n\n4. Lack of healthcare services: Iraq's healthcare system has been severely impacted by years of conflict, making it challenging for teenagers to access adequate healthcare services. This puts their physical and mental health at risk.\n\n5. Social isolation and displacement: Teenagers in Iraq often face displacement due to conflict, which results in them being uprooted from their communities and schools. This disrupts their social connections, and they may have to adapt to living in unfamiliar and unstable environments.\n\n6. Political disillusionment: Many adolescents grow up amidst political instability and corruption, leading to a sense of disillusionment and mistrust towards the political system. This can hinder their motivation to be politically engaged or work towards a better future for their country.\n\n7. Sect"
