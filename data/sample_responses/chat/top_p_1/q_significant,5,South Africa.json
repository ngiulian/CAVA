Zuma's resignation came after mounting pressure within his own party, the African National Congress (ANC), as a result of numerous corruption allegations and lack of effective governance. This event marked a significant turning point in South African politics, leading to Cyril Ramaphosa being elected as the new President and creating a renewed sense of hope for the country. Zuma's resignation highlighted the ongoing struggle against corruption and the need for improved accountability and transparency in South Africa's governance."
