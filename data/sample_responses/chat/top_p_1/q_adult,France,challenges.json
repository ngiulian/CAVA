In addition, high living costs, particularly in major cities like Paris, can put a strain on individuals and families. The French healthcare system, while generally considered high-quality, can also present challenges in terms of access and affordability for certain groups. The country's social welfare system and pension system are also facing issues related to sustainability and adequacy. Furthermore, balancing work and personal life can be a challenge for many adults in France, as the culture places significant value on work and achieving a work-life balance can be difficult. Finally, integration and inclusion of immigrants and marginalized groups continues to be a significant challenge."
