This attack, carried out by the Islamic extremist group Al-Qaeda, involved the hijacking of four airplanes, leading to the destruction of the World Trade Center towers in New York City, significant damage to the Pentagon in Virginia, and a plane crash in Pennsylvania. The attacks resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people and caused a major shift in domestic and international policy, leading to the launch of the War on Terror and subsequent military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq."
