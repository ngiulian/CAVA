                "content": "Seniors in Bosnia and Herzegovina face several significant challenges. Firstly, there is a high poverty rate among the elderly population, making it difficult for them to cover basic needs. This is particularly prevalent among the rural population and those who were affected by the war in the 1990s.\n\nSecondly, healthcare services for seniors are often inadequate. Many elderly individuals struggle with limited access to specialized medical care, long waiting lists, and high out-of-pocket expenses. This is exacerbated by the fact that a significant number of seniors suffer from chronic illnesses and require regular medical attention.\n\nThirdly, social isolation is a major challenge for seniors in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Due to factors such as limited mobility and the loss of family and friends during the war, many elderly individuals are at risk of loneliness and a lack of social interaction. This can have negative effects on their mental and emotional well-being.\n\nLastly, there is a lack of comprehensive programs and support systems for seniors in terms of social protection and pension schemes. Many seniors struggle to receive adequate pensions, leading to financial difficulties and insecurity in their later years.\n\nOverall, the biggest challenges facing seniors in Bosnia and Herzegovina include poverty, inadequate healthcare services, social isolation, and a lack of comprehensive support systems."
