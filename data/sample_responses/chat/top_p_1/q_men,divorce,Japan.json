                "content": "Most men in Japan have traditionally held negative views of divorce and considered it a taboo subject. They often perceive divorce as a failure and a reflection of personal shortcomings, causing feelings of shame and disappointment. This perspective is rooted in the societal expectations of maintaining stable long-term marriages and the emphasis on personal sacrifice and commitment. However, with evolving societal attitudes and increasing gender equality, the perception of divorce is gradually shifting, with some men now acknowledging it as a valid option for resolving unhappy or incompatible marriages. Nonetheless, conservative views still prevail in many segments of society, and men often face pressure to prioritize family harmony and endure unhappy marriages."
