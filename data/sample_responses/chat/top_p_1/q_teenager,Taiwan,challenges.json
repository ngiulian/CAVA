Academic Pressure: The competitive education system in Taiwan places immense pressure on students to excel academically, leading to high levels of stress and anxiety.\n\n2. Parental and societal expectations: Teenagers often face significant pressure to conform to cultural and societal norms, particularly in terms of career choices and academic performance. Expectations from parents, peers, and society can lead to self-doubt and identity crises.\n\n3. Social pressure and bullying: Teenagers in Taiwan sometimes encounter social pressure and bullying in schools, which can negatively impact their mental health and self-esteem.\n\n4. Excessive screen time and digital addiction: The proliferation of technology and the internet has led to issues such as excessive screen time, social media addiction, and cyberbullying among teenagers, impacting personal relationships and overall well-being.\n\n5. Mental health concerns: The stress and pressure faced by teenagers in Taiwan can contribute to mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and suicide rates that are higher than the global average.\n\n6. Lack of work-life balance: Some teenagers experience a lack of balance between academics, extracurricular activities, and personal time, which can lead to physical and mental exhaustion.\n\nOverall, these challenges reflect the complex demands and expectations placed on teenagers in Taiwan and highlight the need for increased attention to their well-being and holistic development."
