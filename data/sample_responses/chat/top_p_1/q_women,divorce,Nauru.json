However, it is important to note that Nauru is a patriarchal society where traditional gender roles are prevalent. Divorce, like in many societies, might be seen as a significant social issue and is likely to be approached differently based on individual circumstances and beliefs. Some women may view divorce as a means to escape abusive relationships or to seek personal freedom and independence. Others may perceive divorce as a disruption to family and community structures, emphasizing the importance of maintaining marriages and traditional values. Overall, the attitudes towards divorce among women in Nauru may vary depending on various factors, including cultural, religious, and personal experiences."
