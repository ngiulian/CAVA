Poverty: Many adults in Papua New Guinea struggle with extreme poverty, with a significant portion living below the poverty line. Limited access to quality education, healthcare, and basic services exacerbates the issue.\n\n2. Limited healthcare access: Access to healthcare is a major challenge in Papua New Guinea, particularly in rural and remote areas. Lack of healthcare infrastructure, shortage of trained medical professionals, and high healthcare costs contribute to inadequate healthcare services for many adults.\n\n3. Gender inequality: There are significant gender disparities in Papua New Guinea, with women facing discrimination and limited opportunities for education and employment. High rates of gender-based violence and limited access to justice further contribute to these challenges.\n\n4. Education: The country faces significant challenges in providing quality education to all its citizens. Limited infrastructure, lack of trained teachers, and cultural barriers prevent many adults from accessing education, limiting their employment opportunities and overall development.\n\n5. Unemployment and underemployment: Papua New Guinea struggles with high levels of unemployment and underemployment. Lack of job opportunities, particularly in rural areas, contributes to poverty and economic instability for many adults.\n\n6.

This hampers economic development and quality of life.\n\n7. Tribal conflicts and violence: The country faces tribal conflicts and violence in certain regions"
