                "content": "Teenagers in Afghanistan face numerous challenges. Firstly, they often face limited access to education, particularly for girls, due to societal and cultural barriers. Secondly, they encounter significant security risks, as the country has been plagued by conflict and violence for decades. These risks include targeted attacks on schools, hindering their ability to attend classes safely. Thirdly, economic instability and high levels of poverty make it difficult for teenagers to access basic needs and opportunities, driving some to engage in child labor or join armed groups. Additionally, cultural norms and gender inequalities contribute to limited options for girls in terms of education, employment, and personal freedom. Lastly, the traditional and conservative society places immense pressure on teenagers to conform to strict societal expectations, limiting their personal and social development. Overall, these challenges pose a major obstacle to the well-being and prospects of teenagers in Afghanistan."
