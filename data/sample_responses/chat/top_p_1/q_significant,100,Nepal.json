On May 28, 2008, the Nepalese Constituent Assembly declared Nepal a federal democratic republic, ending the 240-year-old monarchy. This historic event marked a significant shift in the political structure and governance of Nepal, transitioning from a monarchy to a democratic system. It represented a major milestone in the country's history and paved the way for social, political, and constitutional reforms in Nepal."
