Walking: Since the distance is only 1km, walking can be a practical and healthy option. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes, especially if you plan to carry groceries back.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have access to a bicycle, it can be a quicker and convenient way to reach the grocery store. Just ensure that you follow road safety regulations and have a lock to secure your bike outside the store.\n\n3. Public transportation: Check if there are any bus routes or vans that pass by or near the grocery store. Local transportation options might vary, so inquire with locals or at your accommodation for specific details.\n\n4. Taxi or ride-sharing service: Utilize local taxi services or ride-sharing platforms like Uber or Lyft. Antigua and Barbuda have taxi services available, and you can easily hire them to take you to the grocery store.\n\nConsider choosing the transportation mode that suits your preferences, weather conditions, and availability of resources."
