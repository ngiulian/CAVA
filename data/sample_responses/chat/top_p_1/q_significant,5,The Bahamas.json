It was the strongest hurricane on record to hit the country, causing extensive devastation and loss of life. The storm severely impacted the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama, resulting in the displacement of thousands of people, destruction of homes, businesses, and infrastructure, and a long-term recovery process. The Bahamian government and international organizations worked together to provide relief and support to those affected by the hurricane."
