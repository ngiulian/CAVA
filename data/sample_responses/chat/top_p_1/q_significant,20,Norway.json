This was a twin attack carried out by a single perpetrator, Anders Behring Breivik. He first detonated a bomb in Oslo, targeting government buildings, resulting in eight deaths. Following this, he traveled to the island of Ut\u00f8ya, where he opened fire at a political youth camp, killing 69 people, mostly teenagers. This shocking event had a profound impact on the nation, leading to discussions and debates about extremism, immigration, and national security in Norway."
