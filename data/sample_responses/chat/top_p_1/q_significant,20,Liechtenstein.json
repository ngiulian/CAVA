On December 19, 2011, Liechtenstein joined the Schengen Area, an agreement between 26 European countries that allows passport-free travel and the abolition of internal border controls. This was a major development for Liechtenstein, as it further integrated the country into the European Union and facilitated easier movement across its borders. The adoption of the Schengen Agreement brought various economic and social benefits to Liechtenstein, including increased trade, tourism, and cooperation with its neighboring countries."
