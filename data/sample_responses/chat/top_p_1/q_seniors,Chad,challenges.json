                "content": "Seniors in Chad face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare, high levels of poverty, inadequate social support, and lack of employment opportunities. The healthcare system in Chad is underdeveloped, which means that seniors often struggle to receive necessary medical attention and support. Additionally, seniors in Chad often live in poverty, lacking sufficient resources to meet their basic needs such as food and shelter. This financial strain is further exacerbated by limited social support systems, leaving many seniors vulnerable and isolated. Moreover, there are few employment opportunities specifically catered to seniors, leading to financial dependency and exclusion from the workforce. These challenges collectively pose significant difficulties for seniors in Chad."
