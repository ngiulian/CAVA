                "content": "Some of the biggest challenges faced by teenagers in Gambia include limited access to quality education, economic hardship, lack of healthcare facilities, gender inequality, early marriages, and cultural norms. Many teenagers struggle to access quality education due to a lack of resources and facilities, hindering their opportunities for personal and professional growth. Economic hardship affects teenagers as they often face unemployment and struggle to meet their basic needs. Limited healthcare facilities and services also pose a challenge, as teenagers may not have proper access to healthcare or information on sexual and reproductive health. Gender inequality is another challenge, as girls often face barriers to education and are more likely to be married off at a young age. Cultural norms and traditions may perpetuate these challenges, further restricting teenagers' choices and opportunities for a better future."
