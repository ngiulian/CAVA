                "content": "Most women in France have a relatively progressive and open attitude towards divorce. They consider it a viable option to end an unhappy marriage and prioritize personal happiness over societal expectations. Divorce is seen as a means to escape from unfulfilling relationships, especially when the couple no longer shares a strong emotional connection. Women in France value their independence and believe in the importance of self-realization and pursuing their own desires. They often view divorce as a way to reclaim control over their lives and seek personal growth and happiness. However, it's important to note that individual beliefs and attitudes towards divorce can vary among women in France, and not everyone may hold the same opinion on the subject."
