The conflict started in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and supported separatist movements in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. This has resulted in a protracted war that has claimed thousands of lives, displaced millions of people, and caused significant economic and social upheaval in Ukraine. The conflict represents a major challenge to Ukraine's territorial integrity and has strained relations between Russia and the Western world."
