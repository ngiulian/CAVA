Lesotho gained independence on October 4, 1966, and this event marked a turning point in the nation's history. It marked the end of the colonial era and the beginning of self-governance and sovereignty for Lesotho. The country's independence paved the way for the development of its own political, social, and economic systems, and it became a member of the international community. This event has had a lasting impact on Lesotho and its people, defining their identity and shaping the course of the nation's development."
