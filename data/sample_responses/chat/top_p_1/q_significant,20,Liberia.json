This conflict, marked by intense violence and human rights abuses, resulted in the death of an estimated 250,000 people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands more. It also led to the downfall of the authoritarian regime of President Charles Taylor, who was eventually convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The war significantly devastated Liberia's infrastructure and economy, leaving the country in a state of chaos and instability for years."
