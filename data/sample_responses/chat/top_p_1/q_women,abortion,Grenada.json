Opinions on abortion tend to vary widely across individuals, influenced by personal beliefs, cultural, religious, and social factors. In Grenada, as in many other countries, discussions and debates regarding abortion rights and access continue to be ongoing, with opinions differing among different women and groups. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to generalize the views of all women in Grenada on this matter."
