                "content": "Most men in the Republic of Serbia have varying opinions on divorce. Some view it as a necessary solution for unhappy marriages, while others see it as a failure or a source of shame. Traditional values and societal expectations often influence attitudes towards divorce, and many men may feel societal pressure to maintain the appearance of a stable family unit. However, the younger generation tends to have more progressive views and perceive divorce as a personal choice for individual happiness and growth. Overall, opinions on divorce among men in Serbia can be diverse and influenced by cultural, generational, and personal factors."
