This ambitious reform plan aims to transform the Saudi economy, diversify it beyond oil, and bring about significant social and cultural changes in the country. Vision 2030 strives to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil revenues, attract foreign investment, empower women, expand entertainment and tourism sectors, and promote moderate Islam. This event has had a profound impact on Saudi Arabian society and has set the country on a path towards economic and social transformation."
