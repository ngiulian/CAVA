Walking: As the distance is around 1km, walking can be a convenient and healthy option. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes, use sidewalks or pedestrian paths, and follow traffic rules.\n\n2. Cycling: Taiwan has a well-developed biking infrastructure, and many urban areas have bike lanes. If you have access to a bicycle, cycling can be a quick and eco-friendly way to reach the grocery store.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Taiwan has an extensive public transportation system, including buses and metro systems in major cities like Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Taoyuan. Use a navigation app or website to find the specific routing and bus stops nearest to your grocery store.\n\n4.
