This event marked a historic moment for the country as it transitioned from a Co-Principality, with joint rule by the French President and the Bishop of Urgell, to a parliamentary democracy. The new constitution established Andorra as a sovereign state with a system of government that includes a separation of powers, protection of individual rights, and provisions for the development of democratic institutions. This event represented a significant step towards modernization and increased autonomy for Andorra."
