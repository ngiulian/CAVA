This event, known as the Burkinab\u00e9 Revolution or the October Revolution, was a series of protests and demonstrations against President Blaise Compaor\u00e9's attempt to change the country's constitution in order to extend his 27-year rule. The uprising culminated in Compaor\u00e9's resignation and flight to Ivory Coast. This event marked a major turning point in Burkina Faso's political landscape and led to a period of transitional governance before democratic elections were held in 2015."
