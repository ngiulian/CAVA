                "content": "The most significant event that happened in Cyprus in the past 100 years is undoubtedly the division of the island in 1974. This event, known as the Cyprus conflict or Cyprus crisis, had a profound impact on the country and its people. It resulted in a de facto partition of the island, with the northern part under the control of Turkish Cypriots and the southern part under the control of Greek Cypriots. The conflict started when a Greek Cypriot coup was followed by a Turkish military intervention, leading to widespread violence, displacement, and a political stalemate that has lasted to this day. The division of Cyprus created a heavily fortified buffer zone known as the \"Green Line\" that still separates the two communities. This event greatly affected the political, societal, and economic landscape of Cyprus for the past century."
