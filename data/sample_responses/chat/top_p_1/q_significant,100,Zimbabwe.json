On April 18, 1980, Zimbabwe gained independence from white minority rule after a long period of struggle and armed resistance against colonialism and segregation. This event marked the end of the Rhodesian Bush War and the establishment of Zimbabwe as a newly independent nation. The independence of Zimbabwe was a major turning point in the country's history and had a profound impact on its political, social, and economic development."
