                "content": "Most men in Portugal have gradually accepted divorce as a part of modern society and recognize it as a fair solution to marital problems. They typically view divorce as a means to end a troubled relationship, seeking personal happiness and improved quality of life for both partners rather than staying in an unsatisfactory marriage. Men in Portugal no longer perceive divorce as a taboo or a social stigma, understanding that individuals have the right to make choices based on their own happiness and well-being. However, there may still be some conservative viewpoints among a minority of men who hold traditional beliefs and perceive divorce negatively."
