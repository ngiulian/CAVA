                "content": "Most women in Kiribati generally hold negative views towards abortion. They consider it morally wrong and against their cultural and religious beliefs. The predominantly Christian background in Kiribati, influenced by traditional values and customs, contributes to the strong opposition to abortion as it is seen as taking a life and goes against the sanctity of life principle. Additionally, societal pressures, lack of awareness, limited access to healthcare facilities, and inadequate sexual education may also contribute to the prevailing negative attitudes towards abortion in Kiribati."
