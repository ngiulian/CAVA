However, it can be generally stated that the views on divorce among women in Kosovo are influenced by traditional and cultural factors.\n\nIn Kosovo, where traditional gender roles and conservative societal values are prevalent, divorce is often stigmatized and not widely accepted. Many women may feel societal pressure to maintain their marriage and view divorce as a last resort or a failure. This perspective is partly derived from the cultural expectation that women should prioritize family unity and prioritize their role as wives and mothers. For some women, divorce may carry concerns about losing social status, facing judgment from their community, or being perceived as unable to maintain a stable relationship.\n\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that attitudes towards divorce are evolving, particularly among younger generations who are influenced by more progressive ideas and exposure to a wider range of perspectives. Some women in Kosovo, particularly those who have experienced unhappy or abusive marriages, may support divorce as a means of empowerment and escaping unfavorable circumstances. Economic independence and education also play a role in shaping women's views, as those who are financially self-reliant and have access to education are more likely to consider divorce as an option.\n\nIt is important to highlight that this analysis provides a general overview and that individual opinions on divorce among women in Kosovo can differ significantly based on factors such as age, education, urban or rural background, and personal experiences."
