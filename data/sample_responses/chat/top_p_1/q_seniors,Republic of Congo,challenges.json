                "content": "Seniors in the Republic of Congo face several challenges. One of the biggest issues is poverty, as a significant portion of the elderly population struggles to meet their basic needs. Limited access to healthcare is another concern, with many seniors lacking proper medical facilities and resources. Additionally, the lack of social protection systems, such as pensions or welfare programs, further exacerbates their financial struggles. Ageism and discrimination are prevalent, leading to social isolation and exclusion from opportunities. Overall, the biggest challenges seniors face in the Republic of Congo include poverty, inadequate healthcare, limited social protection, and societal discrimination."
