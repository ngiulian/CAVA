This was the first time in African history that a presidential election result was overturned by a court. The court cited irregularities and illegalities in the electoral process, leading to a political and legal upheaval in the country. The decision played a crucial role in shaping Kenya's democracy and sparked conversations about the integrity of the electoral process."
