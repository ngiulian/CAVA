The healthcare system in Honduras is often stretched thin, making it difficult for seniors to receive the medical attention they need. Additionally, many elderly individuals in Honduras live in poverty and struggle to secure a stable income or social security benefits, leading to financial insecurity and difficulties in meeting basic needs. There is also a lack of comprehensive social support systems in place, including elder care facilities and programs, leaving seniors isolated and vulnerable. Lastly, Honduras faces high levels of violence and crime, which can put seniors at risk and contribute to feelings of insecurity and fear."
