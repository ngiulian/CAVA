Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate summary of what most women in Suriname think about abortion as it would require comprehensive data and individual perspectives. Opinions on abortion can vary widely among women depending on their personal beliefs, cultural background, religious views, socio-economic factors, education, and personal experiences. It is advisable to consult reliable sources, local surveys, or conduct interviews to gain a better understanding of the diverse perspectives on abortion in Suriname."
