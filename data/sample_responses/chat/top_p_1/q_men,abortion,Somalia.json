In Somalia, abortion is generally considered taboo and is strongly influenced by religious beliefs, primarily those of Islam. Islamic teachings generally discourage or prohibit abortion except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. However, it is important to recognize that individual attitudes may differ based on factors such as age, education, personal experiences, and cultural backgrounds."
