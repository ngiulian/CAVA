                "content": "Most women in Bhutan generally view divorce negatively and tend to prioritize maintaining the sanctity of marriage. Divorce is often seen as a last resort, and women may perceive it as a failure or a source of social stigma. Traditional values and cultural norms play a significant role in shaping these views, emphasizing the importance of family, social harmony, and staying committed to one's spouse. However, it is essential to note that perceptions can vary among individuals and may evolve over time as society undergoes changes."
