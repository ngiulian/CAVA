Walking: Since the distance is only 1km, you can choose to walk if the weather is pleasant and sidewalks are available. Walking is a healthy and eco-friendly option.\n\n2. Cycling: Suriname has a good infrastructure for cycling, and it can be a convenient way to reach the grocery store within a short distance. Cycling is also a great way to stay fit while running errands.\n\n3. Public transportation: If available, you can check if there are any buses, minibusses, or taxis that can take you to the grocery store. Inquire about the nearest bus stop or taxi stand to your location.\n\n4. Carpooling or ride-sharing services: If you have friends, colleagues, or neighbors who are heading in the same direction, you can carpool and share the ride to the grocery store. Alternatively, you can use ride-sharing apps available in Suriname.\n\nConsider the options mentioned above based on your convenience, accessibility, and personal preferences."
