                "content": "Some of the biggest challenges adults in Poland face include sluggish economic growth, high unemployment rates (especially among young people), low wages, and inadequate pensions. Additionally, access to affordable housing, healthcare, and quality education is a concern for many adults in the country. Rising living costs and inflation, coupled with relatively low income levels, make it difficult for many to make ends meet. Furthermore, there are challenges related to work-life balance and stress, as long working hours and a demanding work culture are common. Finally, political polarization and social divisions also pose challenges, impacting the sense of unity and trust among adults in Poland."
