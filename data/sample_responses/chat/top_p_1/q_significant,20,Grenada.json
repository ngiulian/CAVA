                "content": "One of the most significant events that occurred in Grenada in the past 20 years is the devastation caused by Hurricane Ivan in 2004. This powerful Category 3 hurricane caused widespread damage across the island, destroying homes, infrastructure, and crops. It led to the deaths of 39 people and left thousands homeless. The aftermath of Hurricane Ivan had a long-lasting impact on Grenada's economy, as it severely damaged the country's tourism industry, which was a major source of revenue. The recovery and rebuilding process were challenging but ultimately helped strengthen the country's preparedness and resilience in the face of future natural disasters."
