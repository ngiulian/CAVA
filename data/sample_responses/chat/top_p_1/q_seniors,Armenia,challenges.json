                "content": "Seniors in Armenia face various challenges, including economic difficulties, healthcare issues, social isolation, and limited access to necessities. The economic hardships often result from pension inadequacy, especially for those who worked in low-paying jobs. This can lead to difficulties in affording basic needs, such as food, housing, and medications. Additionally, healthcare challenges arise due to inadequate medical infrastructure, lack of specialized services, and high healthcare costs. Many seniors experience social isolation, as they may live alone or have limited social interaction, leading to loneliness and mental health issues. Furthermore, access to necessities like transportation, public facilities, and elder-friendly environments is limited, making mobility and participation in society more challenging for seniors in Armenia."
