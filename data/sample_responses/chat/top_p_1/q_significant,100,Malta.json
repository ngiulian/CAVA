On September 21, 1964, Malta officially became an independent nation after years of struggle and negotiation. This event marked a pivotal moment in Maltese history, as it ended more than 150 years of British rule and established the Republic of Malta. The independence of Malta allowed the country to govern itself and shape its own destiny, influencing its political, economic, and social development in subsequent years."
