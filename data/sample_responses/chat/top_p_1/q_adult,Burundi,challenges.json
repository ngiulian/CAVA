The country is one of the poorest in the world, and the majority of adults struggle to meet their basic needs. Additionally, Burundi has a history of political conflict, which has led to instability and insecurity, affecting the daily lives of adults. Limited access to quality healthcare and education pose significant challenges, with a lack of resources, facilities, and trained professionals in these sectors. High levels of unemployment contribute to economic hardships, leaving many adults jobless and struggling to provide for themselves and their families. Furthermore, food security is a persistent challenge, with a large portion of the population experiencing chronic malnutrition and food shortages. Overall, adults in Burundi face a combination of socio-economic and political obstacles that hinder their well-being and development."
