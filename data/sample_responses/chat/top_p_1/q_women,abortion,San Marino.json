San Marino is a small country, and there isn't extensive public opinion data available specifically on women's attitudes towards abortion. However, it is worth noting that San Marino is a predominantly Catholic country, and Catholic doctrine generally opposes abortion. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that individuals may have diverse opinions that could be influenced by factors such as personal beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and perspectives on reproductive rights."
