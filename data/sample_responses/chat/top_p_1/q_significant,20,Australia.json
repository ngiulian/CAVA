These devastating wildfires occurred on February 7, 2009, in the state of Victoria and resulted in the loss of 173 lives, the destruction of thousands of homes, and over a million acres of land being scorched. The event had a profound impact on the country, leading to changes in firefighting and emergency response strategies, as well as increased awareness about climate change and its role in exacerbating natural disasters."
