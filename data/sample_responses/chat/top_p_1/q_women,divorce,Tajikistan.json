                "content": "Most women in Tajikistan hold negative views towards divorce and generally aim to maintain the sanctity of marriage. Divorce is seen as a last resort, taken only in cases of extreme circumstances such as abuse, infidelity, or irreconcilable differences. Women often prioritize preserving their family, social reputation, and children's well-being over their personal desires. They may be willing to endure difficult circumstances or seek help from extended family members, community elders, or religious leaders to reconcile marital issues. Overall, the prevailing attitude toward divorce among Tajikistani women leans towards avoiding it whenever possible."
