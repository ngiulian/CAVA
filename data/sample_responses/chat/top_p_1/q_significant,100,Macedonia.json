The dissolution of Yugoslavia led to a series of violent conflicts in the region, including the Macedonian War of Independence in 2001, which had significant implications for the country's political, social, and economic development. Additionally, the ongoing dispute with Greece over the country's name has been a major issue shaping Macedonia's domestic politics and hindered its international recognition for several years."
