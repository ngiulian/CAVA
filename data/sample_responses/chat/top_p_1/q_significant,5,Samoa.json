The outbreak, which began in October 2019, resulted in the deaths of more than 80 people, primarily children under the age of five. The epidemic led to a state of emergency being declared by the Samoan government, with a mass vaccination campaign implemented to halt the spread of the disease. This event had a profound impact on the country, prompting a heightened focus on public health and vaccination efforts."
