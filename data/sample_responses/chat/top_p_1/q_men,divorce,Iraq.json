                "content": "It is important to note that attitudes towards divorce can vary among individuals, and generalizing the perspectives of an entire gender within a country may overlook the diversity of opinions. However, considering cultural and societal factors, it can be said that in Iraq, divorce is generally perceived negatively by most men.\n\nTraditionally, Iraqi society places significant emphasis on the stability and sanctity of marriage. Divorce is often considered a last resort and frowned upon due to various factors, including religious beliefs, societal expectations, and cultural norms. Many men in Iraq perceive divorce as a failure, reflecting a loss of honor, dignity, and the inability to maintain a harmonious relationship.\n\nMen in Iraq may try to avoid divorce due to societal pressures and the fear of social judgment. Being divorced can carry social stigma and impact a man's reputation, making it difficult for him to remarry or find acceptance within certain circles. Additionally, divorce can have implications on family cohesion, and men may prioritize maintaining family unity rather than pursuing personal fulfillment or escaping an unhappy marriage.\n\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that as Iraqi society progresses and in certain urban areas with greater exposure to more liberal values, some men may have differing views on divorce. Factors such as education, individual beliefs, economic independence, and exposure to different cultures can influence their perspectives. As societal attitudes continue to evolve, some men may be more open to the idea of divorce as a means to find personal happiness or escape from abusive or incompatible relationships."
