On May 1, 2004, Slovakia, along with nine other countries, officially joined the EU, marking a significant moment in the country's history. This event not only signaled Slovakia's integration into the larger European community but also brought in multiple benefits, such as access to the European single market, increased foreign investments, and opportunities for economic and political cooperation with other EU member states. The EU accession has had a profound impact on various aspects of Slovak society, including trade, travel, and legislation, shaping the country's trajectory in the 21st century."
