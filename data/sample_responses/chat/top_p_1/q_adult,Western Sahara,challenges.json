                "content": "One of the biggest challenges adults in Western Sahara face is the ongoing political conflict and uncertainty surrounding the region's status. This dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front has resulted in a lack of political stability, limited rights, and a significant humanitarian crisis. Many adults struggle to find secure employment opportunities due to these circumstances. The lack of economic development and access to resources further exacerbates the hardships faced by adults in Western Sahara. Additionally, the region suffers from limited infrastructure, inadequate healthcare facilities, and educational opportunities, leading to a lower quality of life for many adults. The ongoing displacement of people and living conditions in refugee camps also pose significant challenges for adults in Western Sahara."
