This process began in 2008 with the implementation of a new constitution that granted more power and decision-making rights to the Bhutanese people. This transition marked a significant shift in political dynamics and governance structure in Bhutan, allowing for the election of a parliamentary government and the establishment of democratic institutions. This event emphasized Bhutan's commitment to modernization while preserving its unique cultural heritage and values."
