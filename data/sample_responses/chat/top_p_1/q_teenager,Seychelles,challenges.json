                "content": "Teenagers in Seychelles face several challenges, including limited access to quality education and employment opportunities. The country's education system struggles to cater to the diverse needs of students, resulting in a high dropout rate and limited vocational training options. This hampers their future prospects and contributes to a high youth unemployment rate. Additionally, substance abuse, particularly the use of alcohol and drugs, is a prevalent issue among teenagers in Seychelles. This can negatively impact their physical and mental health, as well as their academic performance. Furthermore, there is a lack of recreational facilities and opportunities for creative expression, which can lead to boredom and frustration among teenagers. Overall, these challenges can hinder their personal and professional development, creating barriers to a successful and fulfilling future."
