They consider divorce to be a viable option for couples who find themselves in an unhappy or dysfunctional marriage. Rather than holding onto an unhappy relationship, the majority of men believe that divorce can provide a fresh start for both partners. They often prioritize personal happiness and fulfillment over societal expectations, understanding that divorce allows individuals to pursue healthier and happier lives. Additionally, men in the Netherlands generally advocate for a fair and amicable separation process, focusing on mutual understanding and respectful collaboration, especially when children are involved."
