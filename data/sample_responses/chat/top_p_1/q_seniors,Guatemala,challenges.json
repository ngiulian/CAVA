                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Guatemala face include high poverty rates, limited access to healthcare, social exclusion, and inadequate pension systems. Many older adults struggle to meet their basic needs due to low incomes and lack of financial support. Healthcare services are often scarce and unaffordable, leaving seniors without proper medical care. Additionally, seniors frequently encounter discrimination and face isolation from their communities, leading to social exclusion and limited opportunities for social engagement. Moreover, the existing pension systems are insufficient, leaving numerous seniors without adequate income to sustain themselves in their old age."
