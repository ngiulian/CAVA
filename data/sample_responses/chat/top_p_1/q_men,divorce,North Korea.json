                "content": "Most men in North Korea view divorce as a very negative and socially unacceptable concept. They generally believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and divorce is seen as a sign of weakness, failure, and disruption of traditional family values. Divorce is heavily stigmatized, and men often feel pressured to maintain dysfunctional marriages, even in cases of abuse or unhappiness. The importance of societal conformity and preserving the harmony within families is prioritized over individual happiness or personal fulfillment."
