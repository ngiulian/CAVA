Some women may view divorce as a viable option to end an unhappy or abusive marriage, seeking personal happiness and liberation. They may prioritize individual rights and the ability to make independent choices regarding their own lives. However, other women might hold more traditional values and may be influenced by cultural, religious, or societal pressures. These individuals may be hesitant to pursue divorce due to social stigma, concerns about children's well-being, or a belief that marriage is meant to be a lifelong commitment. Overall, the attitudes towards divorce among women in Saint Kitts and Nevis likely reflect a diverse range of opinions influenced by various factors including personal experiences, cultural norms, and individual beliefs."
