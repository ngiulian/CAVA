                "content": "In Solomon Islands, most men hold conservative views on divorce. They generally consider divorce to be a last resort and believe that marriages should be preserved through long-term commitment and efforts to resolve conflicts. Men value the stability of families and the traditional roles within them. They prioritize maintaining the unity of their households and often see divorce as a failure or a shameful act. Consequently, many men in Solomon Islands are opposed to divorce and prefer to work towards reconciliation and preserving the marriage."
