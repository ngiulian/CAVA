This agreement brought an end to the insurgency led by the rebel group known as Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) against the Mozambican government. The conflict had been ongoing for decades and resulted in the loss of thousands of lives and extensive destruction. The peace agreement signaled a turning point for Mozambique, offering hope for stability, development, and a more peaceful future for the country."
