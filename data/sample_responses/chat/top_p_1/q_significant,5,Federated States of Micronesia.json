Launched in 2019, this initiative aimed to address the growing waste management and pollution problems faced by the islands in the region, including the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\nThe program focused on improving waste management infrastructure, introducing sustainable waste practices, promoting recycling, and raising awareness about the environmental impact of waste disposal. It aimed to protect public health, prevent environmental degradation, and enhance the overall quality of life in Micronesia and other Pacific Island nations.\n\nThis event holds significance as it represents a collective effort to tackle an issue that affects the entire region. The program's implementation marked a step towards a more sustainable future and showcased regional collaboration in addressing shared challenges."
