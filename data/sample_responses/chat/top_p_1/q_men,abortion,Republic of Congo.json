                "content": "Most men in the Republic of Congo hold conservative views on abortion and generally oppose it. They often consider abortion as morally wrong and incompatible with their cultural and religious beliefs. Many men believe that a woman's role is primarily focused on childbirth and raising a family, and they perceive abortion as an act that goes against these gender roles and societal values. Consequently, they tend to support restrictive abortion laws and advocate for the protection of unborn children. However, it is important to note that perspectives on abortion can vary among individuals, and these views may not represent the entire male population in the Republic of Congo."
