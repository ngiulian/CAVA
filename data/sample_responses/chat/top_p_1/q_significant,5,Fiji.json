Cyclone Winston was the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, with wind speeds reaching up to 298 km/h (185 mph). It caused widespread destruction across Fiji, resulting in the loss of 44 lives and causing extensive damage to infrastructure, homes, crops, and livelihoods. The cyclone had a significant impact on the economy and led to a massive international relief effort to support the affected communities."
