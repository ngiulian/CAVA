This marked the end of colonial rule in Cape Verde and the establishment of the Republic of Cape Verde as an independent nation. The country had been under Portuguese colonization for over 500 years, and its struggle for independence was an important milestone in the history of Cape Verde. The event paved the way for the country's development as a sovereign nation and its subsequent progress in various fields, including politics, economy, and society."
