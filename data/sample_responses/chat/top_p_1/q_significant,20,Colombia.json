After more than five decades of armed conflict, this agreement aimed to end the violence and establish a pathway to peace, reconciliation, and development. It involved various components such as the disarmament and demobilization of the FARC combatants, their reintegration into society, measures for truth, justice, and reparations for victims, and rural development initiatives. The peace agreement was a significant milestone in Colombia's history, representing a step towards ending the longest-running armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere and fostering a more peaceful and stable country."
