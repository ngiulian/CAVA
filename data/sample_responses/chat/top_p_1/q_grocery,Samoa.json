Walking: As it is just 1km away, walking is likely the easiest and most convenient way to reach the grocery store. You can enjoy the scenery, experience the local culture, and it's also a good way to stay active.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle, you can cycle to the grocery store. This would be faster than walking, and it allows you to cover the distance more efficiently while still enjoying the surroundings.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Check if there are any local buses or minibuses operating in your area. They might have a route that passes by or stops near the grocery store. Inquire about the bus schedule and stops to ensure you can easily get there and back.\n\n4. Taxi: Taxis are commonly available in Samoa. You can flag down a taxi, provide the store's address or name, and they will transport you directly to the grocery store. Keep in mind that this option may be more expensive than the others.\n\nChoose the mode of transportation that suits your preferences, convenience, and budget."
