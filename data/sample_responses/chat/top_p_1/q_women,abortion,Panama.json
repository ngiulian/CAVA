Panama, being predominantly a Roman Catholic country, holds conservative attitudes towards abortion. However, not all women in Panama share the same opinion, and some support the right to choose. It is crucial to recognize that there is a range of perspectives and that individuals' opinions may differ significantly on this complex and sensitive issue."
