Walking: If the weather is good and you enjoy walking, you can simply walk to the grocery store. It will take approximately 10-15 minutes to cover a distance of 1km on foot.\n\n2. Cycling: Uruguay is known for its cycling-friendly infrastructure, and if you have access to a bicycle, you can consider cycling to the grocery store. It will likely take you around 5-10 minutes.\n\n3. Public transportation: Check if there are any nearby bus stops or stations that can take you to the grocery store. Look for bus routes that pass by the store's location and take the nearest bus. This option may require checking local bus schedules and planning your trip accordingly.\n\n4. Taxi or ride-hailing apps: You can also take a taxi or use ride-hailing apps like Uber to travel to the grocery store. This option provides convenience and saves time, especially if you have a lot of groceries to carry back home.\n\nRemember to consider factors such as time, convenience, weather conditions, and personal preference when deciding which mode of transportation to use."
