After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moldova declared its independence on August 27, 1991. This event marked a crucial turning point in Moldova's history, ending decades of Soviet rule and providing the opportunity for the country to establish its own government and shape its own future. It paved the way for Moldova's transition to a democratic society and the development of its own national identity. However, it also led to various challenges, including the unresolved separatist conflict in the region of Transnistria, which continues to impact the country today."
