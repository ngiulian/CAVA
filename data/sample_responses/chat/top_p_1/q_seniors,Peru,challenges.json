                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Peru face include poverty, limited access to healthcare, social exclusion, and lack of support systems. Many older adults in Peru live in poverty, partly due to the lack of formal retirement plans and pension systems, making it difficult for them to meet their basic needs. Additionally, healthcare services are often inaccessible or unaffordable for seniors, further exacerbating their health issues. Social exclusion is a significant challenge as older adults are often discriminated against and marginalized, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Finally, there is a lack of support systems and resources specifically tailored to the needs of the elderly, including community centers, transportation facilities, and recreational activities."
