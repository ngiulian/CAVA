After serving as the Prime Minister under President Boris Yeltsin, Putin was elected as President in 2000 and has played a dominant role in Russian politics ever since. His presidency marked a significant shift in Russia's political landscape, consolidating power and centralizing authority in the Kremlin. Putin's leadership has had a profound impact on Russia's domestic policies, foreign relations, and the overall direction of the country."
