This election marked a historic change in the political landscape of the country. It resulted in the first-ever change in government since Malaysia gained its independence in 1957. The long-standing ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, which had been in power for over six decades, was defeated by a coalition of opposition parties called Pakatan Harapan. This event brought about a sense of hope, political transformation, and a shift towards democracy in Malaysia."
