The canal, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, underwent a major expansion project that began in 2007 and was completed in 2016. This project involved the construction of a new set of locks on both ends, allowing larger ships, known as Neo-Panamax vessels, to transit through the canal. The expansion has had a significant impact on global trade, increasing the capacity and efficiency of the canal, and positioning Panama as a key player in international shipping."
