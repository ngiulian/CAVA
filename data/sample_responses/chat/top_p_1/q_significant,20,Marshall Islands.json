In 2003, the Marshall Islands government passed a law declaring its territory a nuclear-free zone, banning the manufacturing, possession, and transportation of nuclear weapons within its borders. This move was particularly significant because the Marshall Islands had been a site for extensive nuclear testing by the United States during the Cold War era. The country still faces challenges related to the lasting impacts of nuclear testing, including environmental degradation and health issues caused by radiation exposure. The establishment of the nuclear-free zone reflects the Marshall Islands' commitment to peace, non-proliferation, and environmental preservation."
