A large amount of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse at the city's port detonated, resulting in a massive blast. The explosion caused widespread destruction, with over 200 people killed, thousands injured, and hundreds of thousands displaced or affected by the damages. The incident had significant socio-political ramifications, triggering widespread protests against government corruption and inefficiency while exacerbating the country's existing economic crisis."
