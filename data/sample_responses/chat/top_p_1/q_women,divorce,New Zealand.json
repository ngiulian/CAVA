They view it as a viable option for dealing with an unhappy or failing marriage, prioritizing their own happiness and well-being. They believe that divorce allows them to pursue personal growth, independence, and freedom from toxic or abusive relationships. Additionally, they see divorce as an opportunity for self-discovery, rebuilding their lives, and finding new love and fulfillment. However, attitudes towards divorce may vary among individuals, influenced by cultural, religious, and personal beliefs."
