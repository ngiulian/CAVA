                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Samoa face include limited access to healthcare services, financial strain, inadequate social support, and a lack of opportunities for active engagement. Many seniors in Samoa struggle to access quality healthcare due to the limited availability of medical facilities and specialists, especially in rural areas. This often hampers their ability to receive necessary treatments and preventive care. Additionally, financial strain is a prevalent challenge for seniors, as many rely on government pension payments or support from their families, which may be insufficient to meet their needs. Social support systems for seniors are also somewhat limited, leading to isolation and loneliness. Lastly, there is a lack of opportunities for seniors to engage in meaningful activities or employment, which can impact their mental and physical well-being."
