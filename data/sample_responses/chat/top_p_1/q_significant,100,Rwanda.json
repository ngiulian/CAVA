                "content": "The most significant event that happened in Rwanda in the past 100 years is the Rwandan Genocide, which occurred in 1994. This event resulted in the mass murder of approximately 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus within a span of 100 days. The genocide was primarily driven by ethnic tensions between the Hutu majority and Tutsi minority, and it had profound consequences for Rwanda and the international community. This tragic event left a deep scar on the country, leading to social, political, and economic challenges that Rwanda continues to address and recover from to this day."
