This event marked the political separation of North Korea from South Korea, which eventually led to the Korean War (1950-1953) when North Korea, supported by China and the Soviet Union, attempted to reunify the peninsula by force. The division has had a lasting and profound impact on the history, politics, and international relations of the Korean Peninsula."
