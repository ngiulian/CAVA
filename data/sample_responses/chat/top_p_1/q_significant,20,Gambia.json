It brought an end to the 22-year-long authoritarian rule of President Yahya Jammeh and marked a significant democratic transition in the country. The election resulted in the unexpected victory of opposition candidate Adama Barrow, who became the new president, leading to a peaceful transfer of power. This event was seen as a major milestone in Gambia's history and brought hope for a new era of democracy and human rights in the country."
