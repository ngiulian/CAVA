This instability hampers economic development and the provision of basic services to its citizens.\n\n2. Limited access to education: Somalia has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, with many adults lacking access to quality education. This hinders their ability to acquire skills, find employment, and participate fully in society.\n\n3. High unemployment: The country experiences high levels of unemployment, particularly among young adults. Lack of job opportunities and a struggling economy contribute to widespread poverty and reliance on informal and precarious work.\n\n4.

Income inequality is also a major concern, as a few individuals or groups control the majority of resources.\n\n5.

This leaves adults vulnerable to preventable diseases and contributes to high mortality rates.\n\n6. Food security and droughts: Somalia frequently experiences severe droughts and food insecurity, which puts immense pressure on adults and exacerbates poverty and malnutrition.\n\n7. Gender inequality: Somali society is characterized by significant gender disparities. Women often face discrimination, limited access to education, and restrictions on their rights and freedoms.\n\n8. Security threats: Adults in Somalia are exposed to various security threats"
