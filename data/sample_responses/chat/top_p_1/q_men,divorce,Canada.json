However, it can be noted that divorce is largely viewed as a complex and deeply personal issue, and attitudes towards it tend to be influenced by individual values, experiences, and cultural backgrounds. While some men may hold negative views towards divorce due to factors such as social stigma, potential financial implications, or emotional upheaval, others may support the idea of divorce as a means to end a dysfunctional or unhappy marriage. Ultimately, it is important to recognize that men's perspectives on divorce in Canada are diverse and can be shaped by a range of factors."
