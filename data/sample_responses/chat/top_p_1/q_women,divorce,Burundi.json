However, it is worth mentioning that Burundi is a conservative society with strong cultural and religious values, which generally discourage divorce. Traditionally, marriage in Burundi is seen as a lifelong commitment, and divorce is often stigmatized. Many women may prioritize preserving the unity of their family and societal expectations over pursuing divorce. Nonetheless, it is essential to recognize that individual women's views can differ widely based on factors such as education, urbanization, exposure to different ideas, personal experiences, and the dynamics of their relationships."
