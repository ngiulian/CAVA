However, it is generally observed that in Madagascar, like in many parts of the world, abortion is a sensitive and controversial subject. Some men may support the idea of abortion under certain circumstances, such as when the pregnancy poses a threat to the mother's life or in case of severe fetal abnormalities. Others may have religious or cultural beliefs that oppose abortion, considering it morally wrong or taking a pro-life stance. Furthermore, societal norms and traditional values may impact men's perspectives on this matter, making opinions diverse."
