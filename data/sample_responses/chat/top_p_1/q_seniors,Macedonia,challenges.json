                "content": "Seniors in Macedonia face several significant challenges. Firstly, there is a lack of adequate healthcare and pension systems, leading to concerns about the affordability and quality of healthcare services for the elderly. Additionally, the country has a high poverty rate among seniors, with many living on insufficient pensions. This financial strain often restricts their access to basic necessities and social activities. Furthermore, limited employment opportunities for seniors make it difficult for them to supplement their income or stay active in the workforce. Lastly, social isolation is a prevalent issue, especially among those living in rural areas or without supportive networks, leading to feelings of loneliness and neglect."
