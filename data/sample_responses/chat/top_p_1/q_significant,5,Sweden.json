It was an act of terrorism when an Uzbekistan-born man deliberately drove a hijacked truck into a crowd of pedestrians on the shopping street of Drottninggatan in central Stockholm. This tragic incident resulted in the death of five people and injured several others. It had a profound impact on Sweden, leading to increased security measures and discussions on immigration policies and national security."
