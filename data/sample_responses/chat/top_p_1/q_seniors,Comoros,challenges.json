                "content": "The biggest challenges that seniors in Comoros face include limited access to healthcare services, financial insecurity, social isolation, and lack of proper care and support systems. Many seniors in Comoros struggle with chronic health conditions but have limited access to healthcare facilities and professionals, especially in rural areas. Financially, seniors often face poverty due to limited pension benefits or lack of financial investments. This leads to difficulties in meeting essential needs such as food, housing, and basic healthcare. Social isolation is also a challenge for seniors, as traditional social structures and support networks have weakened over time. Lastly, the lack of proper care and support systems means that many seniors do not receive adequate healthcare, housing, or social services tailored to their specific needs. These challenges collectively contribute to a vulnerable and marginalized situation for many seniors in Comoros."
