The hurricane was one of the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic basin, causing extensive damage across the Caribbean, including Antigua and Barbuda. The island of Barbuda was particularly affected, with approximately 95% of its structures damaged or destroyed, and the entire population had to be evacuated. The hurricane resulted in the loss of several lives and caused substantial economic and infrastructural damage to the country. The rebuilding and recovery efforts have been ongoing since then."
