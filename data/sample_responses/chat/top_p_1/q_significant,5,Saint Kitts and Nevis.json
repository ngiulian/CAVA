The elections resulted in a change of government, with the opposition party, the St. Kitts and Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP), led by Dr. Timothy Harris, winning a majority. This marked a historic victory as it was the first time in the history of the country that a sitting Prime Minister, Dr. Timothy Harris, was re-elected for a second consecutive term. The election outcome brought political change and set a new direction for the future of the country."
