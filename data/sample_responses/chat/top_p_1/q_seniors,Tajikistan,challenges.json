                "content": "Seniors in Tajikistan face several significant challenges. Firstly, poverty is a prevailing issue among the elderly population as pensions are often insufficient to cover basic needs. This lack of financial security hinders their access to healthcare, proper nutrition, and comfortable living conditions. Secondly, healthcare services are inadequate, with limited availability of geriatric facilities and a lack of specialized medical professionals trained to address the specific needs of seniors. Consequently, illnesses and age-related health issues are difficult to manage effectively. Thirdly, social isolation is prevalent due to the breakdown of traditional family structures, as young adults often migrate abroad for employment, leaving elderly individuals without necessary care and support systems. Lastly, there is a limited focus on promoting active aging and providing opportunities for seniors to engage in meaningful activities, leading to a sense of marginalization and the potential for mental health issues."
