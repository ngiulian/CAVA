Incumbent President John Magufuli, of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, was re-elected for a second term. The election attracted significant attention as it marked the country's first multiparty election under a new constitution that amended presidential term limits. However, the election was marred by allegations of irregularities and restrictions on opposition candidates and media, leading to concerns about democratic processes in the country."
