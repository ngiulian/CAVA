These coordinated terrorist attacks targeted the city's airport and a metro station, resulting in the deaths of 32 people and injuring hundreds of others. The attacks were carried out by ISIS and had a profound impact on both Belgium and Europe, leading to increased security measures and demonstrating the ongoing threat of terrorism."
