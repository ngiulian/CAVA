They often believe that divorce is a sign of failure and a rejection of their role as providers and protectors. Men in Ecuador tend to prioritize the preservation of marriage, sometimes enduring difficult or unhappy relationships instead of seeking divorce. They may perceive divorce as socially stigmatizing, potentially damaging their reputation and prospects."
