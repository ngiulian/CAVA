                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Somaliland face include limited access to healthcare and medical services, poverty and economic hardships, social isolation and neglect, and inadequate support systems for elderly care. Due to the lack of well-equipped hospitals and clinics, seniors often struggle to receive proper medical attention and face difficulties in accessing necessary medications. Many seniors also live in poverty, lacking financial resources to cover their basic needs and healthcare expenses. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack companionship and emotional support, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Furthermore, there is a lack of formalized support systems or institutions specifically catering to elderly care, leaving seniors reliant on their families or communities for assistance. These challenges collectively impact the overall well-being and quality of life of seniors in Somaliland."
