This event represented a major shift in Myanmar's political landscape after decades of military rule. Aung San Suu Kyi's release marked a hopeful step towards democracy, as her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), went on to win a landslide victory in the 2015 general elections. However, it is important to note that Myanmar's recent history has also been marred by the Rohingya crisis and military crackdowns, which have attracted significant international attention and concern."
