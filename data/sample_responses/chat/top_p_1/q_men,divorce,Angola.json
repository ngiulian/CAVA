                "content": "Most men in Angola have mixed views about divorce. While some believe it is a necessary step if the marriage is unhappy or unfulfilling, others perceive divorce as a failure and try to avoid it, prioritizing notions of loyalty and commitment to their partner. Generally, there is a strong cultural emphasis on maintaining the family unit, and divorce may be seen as a disruption to societal norms. However, individual attitudes towards divorce vary based on factors such as education, urbanization, and exposure to more liberal ideas."
