                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Lesotho in the past 20 years was the political crisis that unfolded in 2014. This crisis, also known as the Lesotho political impasse, occurred when Prime Minister Thomas Thabane suspended the country's parliament amidst internal power struggles and allegations of planned military coups. This decision led to a series of protests, and the country faced a period of political instability. Eventually, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) intervened to mediate the crisis, which resulted in a new coalition government being formed. This event significantly impacted Lesotho's democratic process and highlighted the ongoing challenges of maintaining stability and addressing political tensions within the country."
