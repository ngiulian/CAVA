This event paved the way for self-governance and the establishment of a democratic government. It also ended nearly five centuries of Portuguese colonial rule in the islands.\n\nThe independence of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe brought about political and social changes, as the country transitioned to a new era of self-determination.
