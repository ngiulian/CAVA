Walking: If the weather permits and you are physically able, walking can be a convenient and healthy option. Simply put on comfortable shoes and follow the route to the grocery store. Remember to follow pedestrian safety rules and use sidewalks whenever available.\n\n2. Public Transportation: Peru has an extensive public transportation system, including buses and taxis. Check if there is a bus route that goes near the grocery store. You can ask locals or check online for bus routes and schedules. Alternatively, you can hail a taxi from the nearest taxi stand or use ride-hailing apps like Uber or Beat.\n\n3.
