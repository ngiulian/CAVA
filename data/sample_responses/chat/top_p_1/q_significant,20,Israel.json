This event involved the complete withdrawal of Israeli settlers and military forces from the Gaza Strip, an area that had been under Israeli control since the Six-Day War in 1967. \n\nThe disengagement plan was implemented by then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who believed that the move would enhance the country's security and reduce tensions with the Palestinian population. However, the decision was highly controversial both within Israel and among Palestinians. \n\nThe event triggered significant socio-political changes within Israel, leading to debates over the country's borders, national security, and the future of Israeli-Palestinian relations. The withdrawal also had a profound impact on the Palestinian territories, as it created new challenges in governance and led to a subsequent rise of Hamas, a Palestinian political and military organization. \n\nThe disengagement from Gaza is often regarded as a major turning point in Israeli politics, as it sparked discussions on the feasibility of reaching a broader Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and raised questions about the sustainability of Israel's control over occupied territories."
