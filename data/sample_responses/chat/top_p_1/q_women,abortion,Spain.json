However, it is worth noting that Spain has relatively liberal laws regarding abortion compared to other countries. Since 2010, abortion has been legal in Spain up to 14 weeks of pregnancy and under certain circumstances during later stages. Women's views on abortion can be shaped by personal beliefs, religious or cultural backgrounds, and individual experiences. While some women in Spain may support the right to choose and consider abortion as a reproductive right, others may have personal reservations or religious objections. Thus, it is important to recognize the diversity of perspectives among women in Spain regarding this topic."
