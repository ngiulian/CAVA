                "content": "Most women in Kuwait have mixed opinions about divorce. While some view it as a necessary option to escape unhappy or abusive marriages, others maintain a more traditional perspective that divorce should be avoided and marriage must be preserved at all costs. Many women who support divorce believe in their right to end a marriage that lacks love, respect, compatibility, or if it negatively impacts their well-being. Factors such as infidelity, domestic violence, and lack of emotional support can influence their decision to seek a divorce. On the other hand, women who discourage divorce often prioritize social and cultural norms, religious beliefs, and preserving the family unit. They may prioritize reconciliation, counseling, or compromising to save the marriage. Overall, the views regarding divorce among women in Kuwait vary, influenced by personal experiences, cultural norms, and individual perspectives on marriage."
