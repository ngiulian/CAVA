                "content": "It is difficult to provide an accurate summary of what most men in North Korea think of abortion, as public opinion in the country is heavily controlled and monitored by the government. However, it is important to note that North Korean society is highly conservative regarding matters of sexuality and reproduction. The government supports strict regulations on family planning, promoting childbirth as a patriotic duty, and discouraging or even restricting access to abortion. Consequently, it is likely that a significant portion of North Korean society, including men, may align with these prescribed attitudes and view abortion as unacceptable or morally wrong."
