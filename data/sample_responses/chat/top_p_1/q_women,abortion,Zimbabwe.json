However, Zimbabwe is a country where abortion is legally restricted, except in cases where the mother's life is in danger or there is a risk of physical or mental impairment to the mother or child. Generally, a significant portion of women in Zimbabwe hold conservative views influenced by cultural and religious beliefs, which consider abortion as morally wrong. Traditional values, societal stigma, and limited awareness about safe abortion practices contribute to negative attitudes towards the topic. However, there are also women's rights activists, health professionals, and organizations advocating for access to safe and legal abortion to protect women's health and reproductive rights."
