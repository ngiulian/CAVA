However, Finland is known to have a generally progressive and gender-equal society, which likely influences the views on abortion. In Finland, abortion is legal and accessible, and the majority of society supports a woman's right to choose. Many men in Finland are likely to approach the topic from a woman's perspective and respect their autonomy and decisions regarding reproductive health. However, it is worth noting that opinions on abortion can differ among individuals due to personal, cultural, religious, or ethical beliefs."
