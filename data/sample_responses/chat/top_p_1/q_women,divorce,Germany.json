However, divorce is generally seen as a more accepted and viable option for resolving marital issues in modern German society. Many women in Germany view divorce as a means to seek personal fulfillment, independence, and to prioritize their own well-being over an unhappy or dysfunctional marriage. There is also a general emphasis on gender equality, which has influenced women's perspectives on divorce, providing them with the freedom to make choices that align with their own happiness and self-fulfillment."
