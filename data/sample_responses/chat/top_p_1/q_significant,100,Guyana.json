The incident took place in the remote settlement of Jonestown, which was established by the Peoples Temple cult led by Jim Jones. More than 900 people, primarily American citizens, died in a mass murder-suicide orchestrated by Jones. This tragedy had a profound impact on not only Guyana but also the international community and led to increased scrutiny on cults and their practices."
