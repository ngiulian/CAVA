Limited healthcare access: Seniors often struggle to access quality healthcare and specialized services for age-related issues due to limited resources and healthcare facilities in the country.\n \n2. Financial difficulties: Many seniors face financial challenges as their pensions or savings may not be sufficient to cover their needs, considering rising living costs and lack of proper retirement plans.\n\n3. Social isolation: Due to changing social structures and rapid urbanization in Maldives, many seniors may feel socially isolated or disconnected from their communities, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression.\n\n4. Lack of age-friendly infrastructure: The country's infrastructure may not be designed to accommodate the specific needs of seniors, such as accessibility ramps, properly maintained sidewalks, and adequate facilities in public spaces.\n\n5. Limited employment opportunities: Older individuals may face difficulties finding employment opportunities or the ability to transition into new careers, leading to financial insecurity.\n\n6. Inadequate elder care services: The availability of specialized elder care services, such as nursing homes or day care centers, is limited in Maldives, putting additional burden on families to provide support and care for their elderly members.\n\n7. Vulnerability to natural disasters: As Maldives is geographically vulnerable to natural disasters like tsunamis and floods, seniors may face additional challenges in terms of evacuation, access to emergency services, and rebuilding their lives after such events."
