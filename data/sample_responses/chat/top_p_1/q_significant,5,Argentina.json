In 2019, Argentina held presidential elections, leading to the defeat of incumbent President Mauricio Macri and the election of Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez as the new president. This event marked a significant shift in the country's political landscape, as Fern\u00e1ndez's victory brought back the Peronist political party to power after a four-year hiatus. The change in leadership had significant implications for Argentina's economic policies and relations with international partners."
