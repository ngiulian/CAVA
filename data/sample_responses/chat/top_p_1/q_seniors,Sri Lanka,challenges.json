                "content": "Seniors in Sri Lanka face several significant challenges. One major challenge is financial insecurity, as many seniors struggle with a lack of sufficient income or retirement benefits. This often leads to a lack of access to necessary healthcare and difficulties in meeting basic needs. \n\nAnother notable issue is social isolation and neglect. Many seniors live alone, without family support, and feel abandoned or ignored by society. This isolation can negatively impact their mental health and overall well-being. Additionally, there is a lack of age-friendly infrastructure and services, such as accessible public transportation or elder-care facilities, which further restricts seniors' mobility and independence.\n\nHealthcare is also a significant concern for seniors in Sri Lanka. There is limited access to affordable and quality healthcare services, especially in rural areas. This makes it challenging for seniors to receive timely medical attention and appropriate treatment for age-related health issues.\n\nLastly, elder abuse is a growing problem. Seniors often face physical, emotional, and financial abuse, both within their families and in institutional settings. The lack of awareness, inadequate legal protection, and social stigma around reporting such abuse exacerbate this issue.\n\nOverall, seniors in Sri Lanka confront challenges related to financial insecurity, social isolation, inadequate healthcare, and the prevalence of elder abuse. Addressing these issues and improving the welfare of seniors in the country should be a priority for the government and society."
