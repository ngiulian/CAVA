Walking: Djibouti is generally a walkable city, so if you are physically able, walking can be a convenient option. Ensure you follow pedestrian paths and be mindful of traffic.\n\n2. Public Transport: Djibouti has a public bus system called DIT (Djibouti International Transport) that operates throughout the city. Check if there is a bus route that goes near your location and drop off close to the grocery store.\n\n3. Taxi: Taxis are readily available in Djibouti. You can either hail one on the street or use taxi-hailing apps. Make sure to negotiate and agree on a fare before starting your journey.\n\n4. Bicycle: If you have access to a bicycle, it can be an efficient and eco-friendly way to reach the grocery store. Djibouti has some bike lanes and relatively bike-friendly streets.\n\nConsider local weather conditions, personal preferences, and safety precautions while choosing the mode of transportation."
