On August 6, 2008, military officers, led by General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, overthrew the democratically elected President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi. This coup marked the culmination of political tensions and disagreements between the president and the military, mainly concerning the government's response to rising terrorist activity in the country. The military junta dissolved institutions, suspended the constitution, and governed through a High Council of State and a government installed by the military. Although the coup was initially met with international condemnation, Mauritania eventually returned to civilian rule through elections held in 2009. This event had a significant impact on the country's political landscape and stability."
