                "content": "Most men in Indonesia hold a conservative view towards divorce, viewing it as a social stigma and a last resort. They generally see divorce as a failure to uphold religious and cultural values that prioritize lifelong marriages. Many men believe that divorce disrupts family harmony and can have negative implications for children's well-being. While this perspective is predominant, there is a growing recognition that divorce can be necessary in cases of abuse or irreconcilable differences."
