                "content": "Most men in Albania hold conservative views on abortion and tend to oppose it. They consider abortion as morally wrong and believe in protecting the sanctity of life. These individuals generally argue that every unborn child deserves a chance to live, and they prioritize the well-being of the fetus over the mother's choice. Men who hold these views often advocate for stricter abortion laws and restrictions to discourage the practice. However, it is important to note that societal perspectives can vary, and there may be some men in Albania who hold different opinions on this matter."
