Soleimani was the commander of the Quds Force, a branch of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and played a crucial role in expanding Iran's influence in the region. This event dramatically heightened tensions between Iran and the United States, leading to retaliatory attacks, increased regional instability, and heightened fears of a potential military confrontation."
