This revolution occurred during the chaos of World War I and the collapse of the Russian Empire. It led to the establishment of the Ukrainian People's Republic and a period of intense political and military struggle for Ukrainian independence. The revolution had a lasting impact on the country and shaped its political history in subsequent years."
