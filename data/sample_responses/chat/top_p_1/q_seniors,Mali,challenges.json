                "content": "Seniors in Mali face several significant challenges. Firstly, poverty is a major concern, with many seniors lacking access to basic necessities such as food, healthcare, and shelter. The lack of a proper social security system leaves them vulnerable and dependent on their families or charity. Secondly, healthcare is often inadequate, with limited availability of medical facilities, healthcare professionals, and medications, leading to reduced access to essential healthcare services. Additionally, illiteracy among seniors is prevalent, limiting their ability to access information, engage in social activities, and participate in society. Social isolation and exclusion further exacerbate the challenges faced by seniors, as they may feel marginalized and alienated from their communities. Lastly, age discrimination exists in various aspects of life, including employment opportunities, leading to financial difficulties and decreased self-esteem for seniors."
