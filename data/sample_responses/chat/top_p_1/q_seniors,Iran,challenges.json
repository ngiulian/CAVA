Many seniors in Iran face financial difficulties due to inflation and a high cost of living, making it hard for them to meet their basic needs. Healthcare access is another major challenge as seniors often struggle to afford medical services, resulting in inadequate care. Additionally, many elders experience social isolation and loneliness, especially those living alone or with limited family support. They often experience a lack of companionship and engagement in social activities. Moreover, the available government assistance programs are insufficient to meet the needs of all seniors, further exacerbating their challenges."
