                "content": "Seniors in Uganda face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare and social services. Many seniors lack financial resources and struggle to meet their basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing. They often live in rural areas with inadequate infrastructure and lack access to clean water, sanitation facilities, and electricity. Additionally, seniors may experience age discrimination and social isolation, leading to a lack of opportunities for social interaction and meaningful engagement. Overall, the biggest challenges for seniors in Uganda are poverty, healthcare access, and social exclusion."
