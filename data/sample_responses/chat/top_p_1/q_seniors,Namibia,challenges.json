                "content": "Seniors in Namibia face various challenges, including limited access to healthcare services, inadequate social security and pensions, poverty and economic insecurity, high illiteracy rates, and ageism. The healthcare system in Namibia often lacks adequate resources and infrastructure, making it difficult for seniors to access necessary medical care. Additionally, seniors often struggle financially due to inadequate social security and pension schemes, resulting in economic insecurity and poverty. Illiteracy rates among seniors can also hinder their ability to fully participate in society and access information and resources. Lastly, ageism remains a prevalent issue, leading to social exclusion and discrimination against older individuals in various aspects of their lives."
