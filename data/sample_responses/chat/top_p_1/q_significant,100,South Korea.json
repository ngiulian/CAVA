The war began when North Korea, supported by the Soviet Union and China, invaded South Korea, which was supported by the United Nations and the United States. It resulted in a devastating conflict that led to millions of casualties and immense destruction. The war ended in a stalemate and a demilitarized zone was established separating North and South Korea, creating a long-standing division that persists to this day. This event had a profound impact on South Korea's political, social, and economic development, shaping the nation's trajectory and leading to its rapid transformation into a thriving democracy and global economic powerhouse."
