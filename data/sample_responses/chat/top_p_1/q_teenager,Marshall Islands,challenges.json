                "content": "Teenagers in Marshall Islands face several significant challenges. One major challenge is limited access to education and economic opportunities. The education system in Marshall Islands is under-resourced and lacks quality teachers and facilities, hindering teenagers' ability to pursue higher education and secure stable jobs. This, in turn, contributes to high unemployment rates among teenagers, limiting their prospects for a better future.\n\nAnother challenge is substance abuse, particularly with alcohol. Teenagers in Marshall Islands are vulnerable to excessive drinking, leading to various health and social problems. Alcohol abuse can result in poor academic performance, increased crime rates, and strained family relationships.\n\nAdditionally, there is a prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Marshall Islands, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Unhealthy food choices, sedentary lifestyles, and limited access to healthcare services contribute to the high levels of NCDs among teenagers, posing significant health risks.\n\nFurthermore, the impacts of climate change are a pressing challenge for teenagers in Marshall Islands. Rising sea levels, coastal erosion, and extreme weather events threaten the livelihoods and physical environment of the island nation. This creates feelings of uncertainty and insecurity among teenagers, as their cultural heritage and way of life are at stake.\n\nOverall, teenagers in Marshall Islands struggle with limited educational opportunities, substance abuse, high prevalence of NCDs, and the adverse effects of climate change. Addressing these challenges requires targeted efforts from the government and stakeholders to provide better education, combat substance abuse, promote healthy lifestyles"
