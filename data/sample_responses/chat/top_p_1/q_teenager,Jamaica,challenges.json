                "content": "Teenagers in Jamaica face several major challenges. One of the biggest challenges is poverty, as a significant portion of the population lives below the poverty line, leading to limited access to quality education, healthcare, and basic resources. Another key challenge is violence and crime, as Jamaica has high rates of gang activities and violent crimes, which can greatly impact the well-being and safety of teenagers. Additionally, the lack of educational opportunities and high dropout rates contribute to limited career prospects for teenagers, leading to a potential perpetuation of the cycle of poverty. Substance abuse, teenage pregnancy, and limited access to healthcare services are also significant challenges that teenagers in Jamaica face."
