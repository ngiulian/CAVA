The crisis lasted for several years and resulted in a period of political instability, economic decline, and social unrest within the country. It had wide-ranging impacts on the people of Madagascar and its political landscape, including the rise of a transitional government, international sanctions, and a subsequent return to democratic elections in 2013. This event significantly shaped the recent history of Madagascar and its path towards political stability and development."
