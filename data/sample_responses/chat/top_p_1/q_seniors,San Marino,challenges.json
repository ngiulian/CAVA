                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in San Marino face include healthcare accessibility and costs, social isolation, financial insecurity, and limited support services. Healthcare is a major concern as seniors often struggle with accessibility to medical facilities and the high costs associated with treatments and medications. Additionally, social isolation is prevalent among seniors in San Marino, as they may experience loneliness and lack of social interaction due to several factors like limited mobility, living alone, or the loss of friends and family members. Financial insecurity is another challenge, as fixed incomes and rising living costs can make it difficult for seniors to meet their daily needs and maintain a decent standard of living. Finally, there is a lack of comprehensive support services in terms of caregiving, transportation, and assistance programs, which makes it challenging for seniors to receive the necessary support they require to age comfortably and independently."
