Held on March 3, 2019, it marked a major political shift in the country. The center-right Reform Party emerged as the winner, securing 34 seats in the 101-member Riigikogu (parliament). The preceding center-left coalition government led by the Center Party was displaced, bringing in a new government led by the Reform Party and the Conservative People's Party of Estonia. This election reflected a shift in voter preferences and political dynamics in Estonia."
