After decades-long conflict, South Sudan gained independence through a referendum mandated by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) of 2005. This landmark event ended Africa's longest-running civil war and established South Sudan as a sovereign state, making it the youngest country in the world. However, it is important to note that South Sudan has faced significant challenges in its post-independence period, including internal conflict, political instability, and economic struggles."
