Economic difficulties: Many seniors struggle with financial insecurity due to limited income and inadequate pensions. They may face difficulties in affording basic necessities and accessing healthcare services.\n\n2.

This becomes more problematic as seniors require more medical attention to address age-related health issues.\n\n3.
