Protests erupted after allegations of widespread vote-buying and election fraud, leading to the annulment of the election results and the resignation of the then-President Sooronbay Jeenbekov. This event resulted in a power vacuum, and it marked the third time in 15 years that a president was forced out of office due to popular uprisings in Kyrgyzstan. The country then experienced a period of political instability, with different factions vying for power and multiple high-ranking officials being arrested. Ultimately, Sadyr Japarov emerged as a prominent figure, and he was elected as the new President in the subsequent elections in January 2021."
