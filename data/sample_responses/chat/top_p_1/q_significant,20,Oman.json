Sultan Qaboos was the longest-serving leader in the modern Arab world and played a crucial role in transforming Oman into a stable and prosperous nation. His death marked the end of an era and initiated a transition of power to his successor, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said. This event had a profound impact on Oman's political landscape and its future trajectory."
