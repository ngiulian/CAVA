                "content": "Most men in Estonia are generally supportive of divorce and consider it a legitimate option when a marriage is no longer satisfying or functional. They acknowledge that divorce can be a difficult and emotionally challenging process, but believe that staying in an unhappy marriage can be more detrimental to both parties involved. Men in Estonia also value individual freedom and personal happiness, and therefore they tend to accept divorce as a means to regain those aspects of life. Nonetheless, attitudes towards divorce may vary among individuals, influenced by personal beliefs, traditions, and cultural factors."
