This revolution led to the overthrow of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's Communist regime, which had ruled Romania with an iron fist for nearly 25 years. The revolution sparked a series of protests and demonstrations across the country, ultimately resulting in the execution of Ceau\u0219escu and his wife and the end of communist rule in Romania. This event marked a major turning point in the country's history, leading to political, economic, and social changes, including the establishment of a democratic government and Romania's subsequent integration into the European Union."
