This discovery transformed Qatar from a relatively poor and economically dependent region to a prosperous, modern nation-state. The discovery of oil and gas reserves in the mid-20th century ushered in unprecedented economic growth and development, leading to massive infrastructure projects, the establishment of a modern state apparatus, and the creation of a welfare state for its citizens. Qatar's oil and gas reserves have not only made it one of the wealthiest nations in the world but also a global energy powerhouse, allowing it to exert significant influence on the international stage."
