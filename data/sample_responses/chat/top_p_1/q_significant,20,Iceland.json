The country experienced a severe economic collapse with the collapse of its three largest commercial banks. The crisis had devastating effects on the Icelandic economy and caused significant unemployment, bankruptcies, and a sharp decline in living standards for many Icelanders. This event led to widespread protests, the resignation of the government, and a need for international financial assistance. The impact of the crisis still resonates in Iceland today."
