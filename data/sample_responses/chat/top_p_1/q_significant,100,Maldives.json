This event occurred in 2008, marking a substantial shift from a long-standing autocratic rule. \n\nPrior to 2008, the Maldives was ruled by autocratic presidents since its independence from the British in 1965. However, significant political changes were set in motion following a series of pro-democracy protests against the authoritarian regime of President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. These protests led to a new constitutional framework being adopted, allowing for the first multi-party presidential elections to be held in 2008. \n\nIn October 2008, the country held its first democratic presidential election, which resulted in the victory of Mohamed Nasheed, the leader of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP). This historic election marked a major milestone in the country's political landscape as it allowed for a peaceful transition of power from an autocratic regime to a democratically elected government.\n\nThe establishment of a multi-party democracy in the Maldives not only brought political reforms but also facilitated social and economic changes. It opened up avenues for freedom of expression, human rights protection, and increased civil liberties. The event had a profound impact on the country's political and social fabric, setting the stage for subsequent democratic elections and fostering a more inclusive and participatory political environment in the Maldives."
