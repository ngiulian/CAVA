It was a conflict fought between the Republicans, who were loyal to the democratically elected government, and the Nationalists, led by General Francisco Franco. The war had far-reaching consequences, including the establishment of Franco's authoritarian regime that lasted until his death in 1975. The conflict also had an international impact as it became a proxy war between fascist and communist powers, with Germany and Italy supporting the Nationalists, while the Soviet Union aided the Republicans."
