                "content": "Teenagers in South Korea face various challenges, but some of the most significant ones include academic pressure, intense competition, mental health issues, and societal expectations. South Korea's education system is highly demanding, often leading to immense academic stress. The culture of competition among students creates a cutthroat environment where success is often measured solely by exam scores, leading to a lack of individuality and creativity. These pressures can contribute to mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Moreover, societal expectations, such as conforming to beauty standards or conforming to traditional gender roles, can also be challenging for teenagers in South Korea."
