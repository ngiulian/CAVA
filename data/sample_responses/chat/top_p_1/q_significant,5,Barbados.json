On November 30, 2021, Barbados became a republic, removing Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state and replacing her with a Barbadian president. This move marked Barbados' journey towards full independence and further solidified its sovereignty. The transition was celebrated with various ceremonies and events, and it drew global attention as a historic milestone for the country."
