On August 31, 1962, Trinidad and Tobago became an independent nation, marking a pivotal moment in its history. This event brought an end to over 400 years of colonialism and shaped the socio-political landscape of the nation. Trinidad and Tobago's independence led to the formation of its own government, development of national institutions, and the establishment of its own identity as a sovereign nation in the Caribbean."
