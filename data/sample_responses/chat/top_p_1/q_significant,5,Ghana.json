This event marked a major milestone in African integration, as it aims to create the world's largest free trade area, covering 1.3 billion people and a combined GDP of $3.4 trillion. It is expected to boost intra-African trade, enhance economic growth, and foster development across the continent. Ghana was chosen as the host country for the AfCFTA Secretariat due to its commitment to pan-Africanism and its strategic location."
