                "content": "Most women in Swaziland have a negative perception of divorce due to various cultural and societal factors. The prevailing belief is that marriage is a lifelong commitment, and divorce is seen as a failure or disgrace. Women in Swaziland often face significant social and economic repercussions if they choose to divorce, such as loss of financial support, stigma, and potential ostracization from their communities. Therefore, divorce is generally viewed as a last resort and is not readily embraced by most women in Swaziland."
