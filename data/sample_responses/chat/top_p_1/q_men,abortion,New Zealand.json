It is important to note that men's opinions on abortion can vary widely and it is not appropriate to generalize the views of an entire group of people based on gender or nationality. In New Zealand, like in any country, opinions on abortion are diverse and can be influenced by personal, cultural, religious, and individual beliefs. Some men may support a woman's right to choose, believing in reproductive autonomy and female empowerment. Others may hold religious or moral views that influence their opposition to abortion. Similarly, there may be men who have mixed feelings or remain neutral on the subject. It is important to recognize that individuals have unique perspectives and opinions, and these attitudes toward abortion cannot be accurately summarized for an entire population."
