In April 2001, a group of rebels led by Colonel Azali Assoumani seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat, ousting then-President Tadjidine Ben Said Massounde. This event led to political instability and a period of transitional governments. Eventually, in 2002, Assoumani won presidential elections and became the elected president. This event had a profound impact on the political landscape of Comoros and had long-lasting effects on the country's governance and stability."
