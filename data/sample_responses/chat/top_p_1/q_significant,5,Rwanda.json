Rwanda took proactive measures to combat the spread of the virus and implemented one of the most successful containment efforts globally. The government swiftly enacted strict lockdown measures, enforced widespread testing, contact tracing, and quarantine protocols. Additionally, Rwanda's healthcare system was well-prepared, with the establishment of numerous testing centers and the deployment of robots to assist medical staff in hospitals. The country's response received international recognition for its effectiveness in controlling the pandemic and preventing its transmission within its borders."
