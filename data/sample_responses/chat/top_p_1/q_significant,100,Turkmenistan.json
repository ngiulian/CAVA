After being part of the Soviet Union for over 70 years, Turkmenistan gained its independence on October 27, 1991, following the collapse of the USSR. This event marked a crucial turning point in the country's history, leading to the formation of a new government and the establishment of an independent state. Additionally, Turkmenistan's independence allowed for the reassertion of national identity, the adoption of a new constitution, and the introduction of various political, economic, and social reforms."
