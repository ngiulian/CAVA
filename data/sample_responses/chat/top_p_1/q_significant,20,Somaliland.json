Somaliland, a self-declared independent state in the northern part of Somalia, has managed to conduct several peaceful and transparent elections since its declaration of independence in 1991.\n\nThese elections have been hailed by international observers as free and fair, highlighting Somaliland's commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law. The 2017 presidential elections, in particular, were considered a landmark event, as they marked the first ever transfer of power from one elected president to another in Somaliland's history.\n\nThese democratic elections have strengthened the legitimacy of Somaliland's self-declared independence and have showcased its ability to govern effectively and democratically. The successful conduct of these elections has also contributed to the stability and relative peace in Somaliland, distinguishing it from the rest of Somalia which continues to struggle with political instability and violence."
