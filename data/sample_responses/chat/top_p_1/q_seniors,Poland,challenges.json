                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Poland face include financial struggles, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and lack of support for the aging population. Many seniors in Poland live on low pensions, which make it difficult to meet their daily needs and afford medical expenses. Additionally, the healthcare system in Poland faces challenges like lengthy waiting times and understaffed facilities, making it difficult for seniors to access necessary medical care. Social isolation is also a concern, as seniors may experience loneliness and lack of companionship. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive support systems and policies catering to the needs of the aging population poses challenges in areas like housing, employment opportunities, and transportation."
