San Marino, a microstate located within Italy, became a member of the UN on March 2, 1992. This event marked an important milestone for San Marino's international recognition and its participation in global affairs. It allowed the country to strengthen its diplomatic and political presence on the international stage, contributing to its sovereignty and status as an independent state."
