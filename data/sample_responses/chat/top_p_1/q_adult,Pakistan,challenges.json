The country's high population growth rate exacerbates these challenges, leading to a strain on resources and services. Additionally, gender inequality, especially in rural areas, remains a significant hurdle for women, limiting their opportunities for education and workforce participation. Political instability, corruption, and terrorism also pose significant challenges, impacting the overall security and well-being of adults in Pakistan."
