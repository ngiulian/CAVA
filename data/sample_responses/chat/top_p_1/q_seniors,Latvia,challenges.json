                "content": "Some of the biggest challenges seniors in Latvia face include limited access to healthcare and social services, financial difficulties, isolation and loneliness, and discrimination based on age. Limited access to quality healthcare services and lack of affordable medications make it difficult for seniors to maintain their health. Many seniors also struggle with financial difficulties, as their pension might not be sufficient to cover basic expenses. Due to changes in family structures and migration, some seniors experience social isolation and loneliness, leading to mental health issues. Additionally, they may face discrimination in employment and societal participation based on their age. These challenges highlight the need for better support systems and policies to ensure the well-being and inclusion of seniors in Latvian society."
