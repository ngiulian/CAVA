                "content": "Most men in Burkina Faso hold negative views towards divorce. They consider divorce as a sign of failure and a threat to social stability. They generally believe that marital problems should be resolved through compromise and mediation rather than through divorce. Divorce is often seen as a last resort, primarily in cases of severe conflict, infidelity, or abuse. Additionally, traditional and cultural values place a strong emphasis on maintaining the institution of marriage and preserving the family unit, further influencing men's perspectives on divorce in Burkina Faso."
