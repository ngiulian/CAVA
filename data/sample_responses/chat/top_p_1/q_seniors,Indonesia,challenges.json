                "content": "Seniors in Indonesia face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare and social services, financial insecurity, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford quality healthcare, as the cost of medical services and medications can be prohibitive. Additionally, there is a lack of geriatric care infrastructure, which leads to inadequate support for seniors with chronic conditions and disabilities. Financial insecurity is another challenge, as many seniors have insufficient pensions or rely solely on their families for support. This can leave them vulnerable to poverty and exploitation. Social isolation is prevalent among seniors, especially those living in rural areas, due to limited social activities and transportation difficulties. Finally, age discrimination exists in various forms, such as limited job opportunities and stereotypes that marginalize seniors and deny them full participation in society."
