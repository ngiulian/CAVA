Peer pressure and the influence of western media also impact their identity formation and cultural values. Lack of extracurricular activities and limited public spaces restrict their opportunities for recreation and personal development. Additionally, academic pressure, strict societal expectations, and gender inequality may contribute to stress and affect mental health. Finally, the transition from adolescence to adulthood, including choosing career paths and navigating the job market, poses significant challenges for Kuwaiti teenagers."
