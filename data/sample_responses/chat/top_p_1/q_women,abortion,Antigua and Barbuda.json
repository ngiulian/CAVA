However, the society in Antigua and Barbuda generally holds conservative values, influenced by religious beliefs and cultural norms. As a result, there is a significant portion of the population, including women, who hold pro-life views and view abortion as morally wrong. Traditional family structures are valued, and motherhood is often seen as an important role for women.\n\nThat being said, views on abortion are not monolithic, and there are women who support a woman's right to choose, especially in cases of rape, incest, or serious health risks. Women's access to reproductive healthcare, including safe and legal abortion, is a complex and debated issue in the country. Public opinion may vary depending on factors such as age, education, urban versus rural location, and personal experiences."
