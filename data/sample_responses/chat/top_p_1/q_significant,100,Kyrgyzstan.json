The uprising, also known as the \"March revolution,\" was a series of protests and demonstrations that led to the overthrow of President Askar Akayev, who had held power since Kyrgyzstan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The revolution was largely driven by frustration with corruption, economic mismanagement, and the Akayev government's authoritarian practices. This event marked a significant shift in Kyrgyzstan's political landscape and initiated a period of democratic reforms and political transformation."
