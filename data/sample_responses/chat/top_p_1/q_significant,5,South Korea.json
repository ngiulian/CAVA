This summit marked a breakthrough in relations between North and South Korea, as it was the first meeting between the leaders of the two countries in over a decade. The summit took place at the Panmunjom village, located in the demilitarized zone (DMZ), and was attended by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The two leaders discussed various issues, including denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, establishing peace, and furthering inter-Korean cooperation. The summit had significant symbolic value, raising hopes for improved relations and reducing tensions between the two Koreas."
