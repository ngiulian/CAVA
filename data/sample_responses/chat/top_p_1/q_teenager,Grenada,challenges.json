                "content": "Teenagers in Grenada face several challenges, including limited educational opportunities, unemployment, drug abuse, and peer pressure. Many schools in Grenada lack adequate resources and facilities, providing limited access to quality education. This hinders teenagers' chances of acquiring necessary skills for future success. Furthermore, the problem of youth unemployment is prevalent, leading to a lack of opportunities and financial instability for teenagers. Drug abuse is another major challenge, with some teenagers falling into substance addiction due to factors like societal influences or stress. Peer pressure, particularly in social settings, can also negatively impact teenagers, often leading to unhealthy behaviors and decision-making. These challenges collectively affect the overall well-being and development of teenagers in Grenada."
