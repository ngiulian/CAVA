                "content": "It is challenging to generalize the thoughts of a whole population, but based on various surveys and public opinion, it is known that the majority of men in Malta hold conservative views regarding abortion. Malta is one of the countries in Europe where abortion is highly restricted and only permitted in exceptional circumstances, creating a strong pro-life sentiment within the society. Many men in Malta, influenced by cultural, religious, and traditional beliefs, often oppose the legalization and accessibility of abortion. This viewpoint is shaped by the dominant influence of Catholicism in the country, which regards abortion as morally wrong. However, it is important to note that opinions may vary among individuals, and some men may hold differing views on this topic."
