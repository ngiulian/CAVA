                "content": "Most women in Guinea hold negative views towards divorce, considering it as a failure of marriage and a source of shame. Divorce is generally stigmatized in their society, and women often face social pressure and discrimination if they seek separation. Many believe that divorce should only be considered under extreme circumstances, such as physical abuse or infidelity. However, it is important to note that individuals' perspectives may vary based on personal experiences and cultural backgrounds."
