                "content": "Most women in Malaysia hold conservative views on abortion. They generally believe that abortion is morally wrong and should only be considered in cases of extreme medical necessity or a threat to the mother's life. The majority adhere to religious and cultural beliefs that prioritize the preservation of life and emphasize the sanctity of unborn children. Consequently, there is limited support for more liberal abortion laws, and societal attitudes tend to discourage discussing or openly advocating for abortion rights."
