                "content": "Some of the biggest challenges seniors in Bulgaria face include social isolation, financial difficulties, inadequate healthcare, and limited access to social services. Social isolation can be caused by decreased social interactions, loss of friends and family members, and lack of transportation options. Financial difficulties arise due to inadequate pensions and rising living costs, resulting in difficulties in meeting basic needs and affording healthcare. Additionally, seniors often face challenges in accessing quality healthcare services due to long waiting times, insufficient funding, and limited access to specialists. The availability and accessibility of social services are also limited, making it difficult for seniors to access support for their everyday needs."
