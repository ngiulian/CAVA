                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Lebanon face include limited access to healthcare and financial support, social isolation, inadequate retirement benefits, and a lack of specialized facilities and services for their specific needs. The country's ongoing economic crisis has strained the healthcare system, making it difficult for seniors to receive proper medical care. Many seniors also struggle financially due to low retirement benefits or lack of financial support systems. Social isolation is a common issue, as seniors often face loneliness and lack of opportunities for social engagement. Additionally, there is a scarcity of elderly care facilities and services, making it challenging for seniors to find appropriate living arrangements or necessary assistance."
