On August 18, 2020, the Malian military seized power and deposed President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta following widespread protests against his government's perceived corruption, ineptitude, and failure to address the country's security and economic challenges. The coup led to a power vacuum and political instability in the country, resulting in calls for a transition to civilian rule and the involvement of regional and international organizations in mediating the crisis. The events of the coup had a profound impact on Mali's political landscape and its efforts to address numerous challenges, including ongoing conflicts, terrorism, and economic development."
