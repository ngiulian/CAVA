However, as Libya is a conservative society with strong cultural and religious influences, many men may hold traditional and conservative views regarding abortion. These beliefs likely stem from Islamic teachings, which generally consider abortion, except in specific circumstances, as morally wrong. However, it is important to note that individual opinions may differ within this context, influenced by personal experiences, education, and exposure to different perspectives."
