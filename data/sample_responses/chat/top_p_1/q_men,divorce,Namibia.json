                "content": "Most men in Namibia tend to have traditional and conservative views towards divorce. They generally view divorce as a negative and undesirable outcome, preferring to prioritize family unity and stability. Many men in Namibia believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and that divorce should be avoided if possible. They are often influenced by cultural and religious beliefs that emphasize the importance of maintaining the family structure. Consequently, most men in Namibia tend to be less accepting of divorce compared to other countries with more liberal attitudes towards marital dissolution."
