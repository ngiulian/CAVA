Furthermore, it is essential to respect and value diverse opinions surrounding sensitive topics such as abortion. However, it can be said that in Niger, a predominantly Muslim country with strong cultural and religious influences, traditional values and beliefs often shape people's opinions on abortion, including those held by men.\n\nIn general, Niger is known for its conservative stance on matters related to women's reproductive rights, which includes a generally negative perception of abortion. Islamic teachings, which guide the beliefs of many individuals in Niger, largely consider abortion as haram (forbidden) except in specific situations, such as to save the life of the mother. This religious influence reinforces the belief that life begins at conception, leading to a broader societal viewpoint that regards abortion as morally wrong.\n\nMoreover, Niger's cultural and social norms further contribute to the prevailing perception of abortion. The society places great importance on family, community, and the continuity of one's lineage. Therefore, the idea of terminating a pregnancy is often seen as disrupting the natural order, breaking familial and societal expectations, and potentially leading to the loss of future generations. Additionally, discussions around sexuality and reproductive health are often considered taboo, making it difficult to openly discuss topics like abortion.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that there may be individuals who hold different perspectives and see abortion as a personal choice"
