The separation was a result of political and ideological differences between the ruling party in Singapore, the People's Action Party led by Lee Kuan Yew, and the Malaysian federal government. \n\nThe decision to become an independent nation was met with skepticism and concerns about Singapore's viability as a small city-state with limited natural resources. However, under the leadership of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore embarked on a path of economic development, social restructuring, and nation-building that transformed it into one of the world's most prosperous and technologically advanced countries.\n\nThe event marked a turning point in Singapore's history, shaping its identity as a sovereign nation and setting the stage for its rapid economic growth and development. Today, Singapore is recognized as a global financial hub, has one of the highest standards of living, and is known for its efficient governance, urban planning, and multicultural society."
