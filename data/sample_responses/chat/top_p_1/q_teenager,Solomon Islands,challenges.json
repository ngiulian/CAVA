                "content": "Teenagers in Solomon Islands face several challenges, including limited access to quality education and healthcare facilities. High rates of poverty and unemployment pose obstacles to their future prospects and economic stability. Limited opportunities for skills development and vocational training further hinder their chances of finding employment. Additionally, limited infrastructure and resources in rural areas often result in inadequate access to basic services such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity. Teenagers also face cultural and societal pressures, including early marriage, teenage pregnancy, and gender inequality. Moreover, the prevalence of substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drugs, can negatively impact their well-being. Finally, the country's susceptibility to natural disasters, such as cyclones and earthquakes, increases the vulnerability of teenagers and disrupts their education and daily lives."
