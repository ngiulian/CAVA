The country has experienced a protracted civil war, leading to displacement and a severe humanitarian crisis. This presents challenges in terms of food insecurity, inadequate healthcare, and lack of education opportunities for adults. Additionally, South Sudan's economy is highly dependent on agriculture, which is vulnerable to climate change and recurrent droughts, affecting livelihoods. The country also has a high prevalence of communicable diseases, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to clean water, increasing health risks for adults. Overall, adults in South Sudan face significant difficulties in rebuilding their lives and achieving stability amidst ongoing challenges."
