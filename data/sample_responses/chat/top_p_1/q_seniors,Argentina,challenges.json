There is also a lack of access to quality healthcare and affordable medications. Social isolation and loneliness are common issues, especially among those living alone or without family support. Seniors also often face difficulties in accessing transportation and housing options that meet their specific needs. Furthermore, age discrimination and limited opportunities for active participation in society are additional challenges that seniors in Argentina encounter."
