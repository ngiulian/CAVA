In that year, Germany received a large influx of refugees and asylum seekers, primarily fleeing conflicts in the Middle East and Northern Africa. This event had significant social, political, and economic implications for the country, and it sparked intense debates and divisions among the German population and European Union member states regarding immigration policies and integration. The scale and impact of the refugee crisis make it one of the most significant events to have occurred in Germany in recent years."
