Public opinion on abortion in Saint Lucia tends to be influenced by a combination of cultural, religious, and personal beliefs. The country is predominantly Catholic, and Catholic teachings generally oppose abortion. However, like in many societies, there are diverse opinions among women in Saint Lucia, with some supporting a woman's right to choose and others advocating for strict restrictions on abortion. It is important to note that perspectives may also differ based on factors such as education, personal experiences, and exposure to differing viewpoints."
