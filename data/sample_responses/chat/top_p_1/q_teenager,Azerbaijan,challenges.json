                "content": "Teenagers in Azerbaijan face several challenges, including limited educational opportunities, economic pressures, cultural and societal expectations, and a lack of recreational activities.\n\nOne major challenge is the limited educational opportunities available to teenagers. While primary education is widely accessible, there is a lack of quality secondary education options, especially in rural areas. This often results in inadequate preparation for higher education or future career prospects.\n\nEconomic pressures also pose a significant challenge for teenagers in Azerbaijan. High levels of youth unemployment and limited job prospects make it difficult for them to secure stable employment. Many teenagers must rely on family support or engage in informal work to contribute to household income, limiting their ability to pursue personal aspirations.\n\nCultural and societal expectations can also be burdensome for teenagers in Azerbaijan. Traditional gender roles and conservative values can restrict personal freedoms, particularly for young women. This often includes limited autonomy in decision-making, restrictions on dress and behavior, and pressure to conform to societal norms.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of recreational activities contributes to the challenges faced by teenagers. Limited access to safe and inclusive spaces for socializing and engaging in extracurricular activities can lead to boredom and feelings of isolation. This lack of outlets for personal expression and growth can affect their overall well-being and development.\n\nIn summary, the biggest challenges for teenagers in Azerbaijan include limited educational opportunities, economic pressures, cultural expectations, and a lack of recreational activities. Addressing these challenges requires investment in inclusive education, job creation, promoting gender equality, and providing accessible and diverse recreational opportunities"
