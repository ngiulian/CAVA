                "content": "Teenagers in Vanuatu face several challenges, including limited access to education, high rates of poverty, lack of employment opportunities, inadequate healthcare services, and issues related to gender inequality. Many teenagers struggle to receive a quality education due to limited resources, expensive school fees, and a lack of schools in rural areas. This further exacerbates the issue of high school dropout rates and limited skills development. The prevalence of poverty in the country also affects teenagers, leading to barriers in accessing basic necessities like food, clean water, and proper healthcare. Additionally, limited employment opportunities after schooling contribute to unemployment rates among teenagers. Gender inequality is another challenge faced by teenagers, where young girls often face discrimination, early marriages, and limited opportunities for personal growth and development. Overall, these challenges pose significant obstacles to the well-being and future prospects of teenagers in Vanuatu."
