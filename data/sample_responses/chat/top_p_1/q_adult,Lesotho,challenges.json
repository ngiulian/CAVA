                "content": "Some of the biggest challenges adults in Lesotho face include high poverty rates, limited access to health care and education, high unemployment rates, and widespread HIV/AIDS prevalence. The country's rugged terrain and harsh climate make agriculture difficult, exacerbating food insecurity and poverty. Lack of access to quality healthcare services and education further cripples socio-economic development. Unemployment is a major concern, with limited job opportunities and a reliance on informal sector employment. Lesotho has one of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates globally, leading to significant health issues and social stigmatization. All of these challenges contribute to the overall struggles faced by adults in Lesotho."
