                "content": "Teenagers in Brunei face a range of challenges. One prominent challenge is the lack of suitable recreational activities, which often leads to boredom and potential engagement in unhealthy behaviors. Limited access to entertainment facilities, such as movie theaters or amusement parks, contributes to this issue. Additionally, there is a lack of variety in extracurricular activities in schools, restricting opportunities for personal growth and skill development. \n\nAnother challenge is the pressure to conform to cultural and societal expectations. Brunei is a conservative society, and teenagers might find it difficult to express their individuality and explore their own identities. Traditional gender roles are also emphasized, which can restrict the aspirations and opportunities available to teenagers. \n\nFurthermore, the education system in Brunei places a strong emphasis on academic achievement, which can lead to intense competition and significant stress among teenagers. High expectations from parents and the education system can create pressure that affects mental health and well-being. \n\nFinally, access to comprehensive and accurate sexual education is limited, leading to a lack of knowledge and awareness regarding sexual health and relationships. This can result in risky behaviors and poor decision-making regarding sexual matters."
