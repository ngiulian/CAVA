In 2011, inspired by protests in other Arab countries, Jordan witnessed its own wave of protests and calls for political reforms, economic improvements, and an end to corruption. These protests, while peaceful compared to other countries in the region, had a significant impact on Jordan's political landscape and led to some political reforms, including the appointment of a prime minister based on parliamentary elections rather than royal appointment. It also highlighted the deep social and economic challenges that Jordan faces, such as high unemployment rates and poverty. The Arab Spring uprising and its aftermath continue to shape Jordan's political and social dynamics today."
