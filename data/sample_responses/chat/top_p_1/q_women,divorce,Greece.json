They view it as a last resort and believe it should be avoided if possible to maintain and protect the family unit. Divorce is often seen as a source of shame, as women may face social stigma and judgment from their community. Additionally, women often prioritize the well-being of their children over their own personal happiness, leading them to tolerate unhappy marriages."
