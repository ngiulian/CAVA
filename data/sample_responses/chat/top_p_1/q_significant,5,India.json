                "content": "One of the most significant events that occurred in India in the past 5 years was the revocation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in August 2019. Article 370 granted special autonomous status to the region of Jammu and Kashmir, allowing it to have its own constitution and governing powers. The decision to scrap Article 370 resulted in the reorganization of Jammu and Kashmir into two separate union territories directly governed by the central government of India. This move had significant political, social, and security implications, leading to widespread debates and discussions within the country and the international community."
