Some may view it as a negative aspect, emphasizing the importance of preserving the sanctity of marriage and upholding traditional gender roles, while considering divorce as a disruption to social harmony. Others may hold more progressive attitudes, recognizing that divorce can be a necessary step to escape unhealthy or abusive relationships, understanding that personal happiness and well-being should take precedence. These differing views may be influenced by factors such as cultural, religious, and societal beliefs prevalent in Fiji."
