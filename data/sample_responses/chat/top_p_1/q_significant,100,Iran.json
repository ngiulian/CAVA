This event brought about the overthrow of Iran's monarchy and the establishment of an Islamic republic. The revolution was a result of widespread dissatisfaction with the autocratic rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was seen as a puppet of Western powers, particularly the United States. The revolution was led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a prominent Shia cleric, who eventually became Iran's Supreme Leader. The revolution had far-reaching consequences both domestically and internationally, significantly changing Iran's political, social, and religious landscape, and redefining its relationship with the rest of the world."
