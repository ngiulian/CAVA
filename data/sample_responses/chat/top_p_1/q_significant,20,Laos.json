The NT2 dam is a large hydroelectric dam built on the Nam Theun River in central Laos, with the capacity to generate 1,070 megawatts of electricity. It was completed in 2010 and has had a significant impact on the country's economy and energy sector. The project involved the resettlement of local communities and faced criticism from environmental organizations for its potential adverse effects on the environment. However, it also brought in foreign investment and contributed to Laos' efforts to transition to a more sustainable energy system."
