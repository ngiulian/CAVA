However, it can be said that abortion is not universally accepted in Thailand due to various factors such as cultural, religious, and societal influences.\n\nThailand is a predominantly Buddhist country, and while Buddhism does not explicitly discuss abortion, it emphasizes respect for life. Consequently, some women may align their views against abortion based on these religious beliefs. Additionally, Thai society generally values traditional family structures and conservative norms, which can contribute to negative perceptions of abortion.\n\nHowever, it is not uncommon for Thai women to have more progressive views towards abortion, especially among the younger generation and those with exposure to urban and Westernized influences. For some, the freedom to choose and control their reproductive health is regarded as a fundamental right. They may advocate for the availability and accessibility of safe, legal abortion services as a means of safeguarding women's rights and providing options in unintended pregnancy situations.\n\nOverall, it is essential to recognize that opinions regarding abortion in Thailand vary based on factors such as religion, cultural background, education, and exposure to different ideologies. It would be inaccurate to summarize the views of \"most women in Thailand\" as a singular perspective."
