Gender-based violence and discrimination, as well as the HIV/AIDS epidemic, also present significant challenges for adults in the country. Additionally, political and economic instability, corruption, and a lack of economic opportunities further exacerbate these challenges, making it difficult for adults to improve their lives and secure a better future for themselves and their families."
