                "content": "The biggest challenges faced by seniors in Jamaica include poverty, limited access to quality healthcare, lack of social support, and discrimination. Many seniors live in poverty due to inadequate pensions and minimal social welfare programs. This often results in difficulties affording basic necessities, housing, and healthcare expenses. The healthcare system is strained, with limited resources and specialized geriatric care services. Furthermore, seniors often experience social isolation due to the loss of spouses, friends, and limited intergenerational interactions. Discrimination based on age can also hinder seniors' access to employment, financial services, and social opportunities."
