                "content": "Most women in the Netherlands have a positive and pragmatic outlook towards divorce. They consider divorce as a viable option to end an unhappy or unhealthy marriage. Women often prioritize their own well-being, personal growth, and happiness over staying in an unsatisfying relationship. They believe in the importance of individual freedom and personal fulfillment, valuing independence and self-sufficiency. Dutch women tend to approach divorce in a pragmatic manner, considering the impact on themselves as well as their children, and they often aim for an amicable and fair settlement. Divorce is seen as a way to create a new and better life after the end of a marriage, and societal stigma around divorce is relatively low in the Netherlands."
