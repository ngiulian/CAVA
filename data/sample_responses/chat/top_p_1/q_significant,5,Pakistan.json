This operation was aimed at combating terrorism and eliminating militant groups in the country, particularly in the volatile North Waziristan region. It involved a major military offensive that saw the Pakistani army conducting targeted airstrikes and ground offensive operations against various extremist organizations. This operation marked a significant turning point in Pakistan's fight against terrorism as it resulted in the elimination of many top militant leaders and disrupted their networks."
