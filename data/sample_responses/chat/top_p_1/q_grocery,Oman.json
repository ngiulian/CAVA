Walking: If the weather permits and you enjoy walking, you can simply walk to the grocery store. It will take you approximately 10-15 minutes to cover 1km.\n\n2. Cycling: Another option is to ride a bicycle to the grocery store. Bicycles are a popular mode of transportation in Oman, and you can reach your destination quickly while enjoying some exercise.\n\n3. Public transportation: Check if there are any local buses or mini-buses that pass by the grocery store. This could be a convenient and affordable option for you. You might have to wait a bit for the bus and consult a local schedule or ask around. Make sure to have some small notes or coins ready for the fare.\n\n4. Taxi: Taxis are widely available in Oman, and you can easily find one to take you to the grocery store. It's a quick and comfortable option, but it might be slightly more expensive compared to other alternatives.\n\nConsider the weather, your budget, and your preference for convenience, and choose the mode of transportation that suits you best."
