They spend a significant amount of time on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, constantly posting and consuming content. This obsession often leads to decreased face-to-face interactions, reduced physical activities, and a shift in priorities. Additionally, there is a growing dependency on smartphones, with many children constantly checking their devices for notifications and updates. This obsession can have negative effects on their overall well-being, including mental health issues and decreased academic performance."
