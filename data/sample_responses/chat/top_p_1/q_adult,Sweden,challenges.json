The cost of housing, education, and healthcare is relatively high, making it difficult for adults to afford a comfortable lifestyle. The job market can be competitive, leading to unemployment or underemployment. High taxes can also be a burden for individuals and families. Mental health issues, including stress and anxiety, are prevalent and can affect well-being. Lastly, maintaining a healthy work-life balance can be challenging due to long working hours and societal expectations."
