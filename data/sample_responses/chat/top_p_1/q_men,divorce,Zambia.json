                "content": "Most men in Zambia tend to have negative views and reservations about divorce. They consider divorce to be a shameful and undesirable outcome, as it goes against their cultural and religious beliefs that emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and lasting marriage. Men often perceive divorce as a failure of their masculinity and reputation as providers and caretakers of their families. They are generally expected to take responsibility for their marital issues and make efforts to reconcile and preserve the relationship, even in difficult circumstances. However, it's important to note that attitudes toward divorce can vary among individuals based on their personal experiences, education, and exposure to different cultural influences."
