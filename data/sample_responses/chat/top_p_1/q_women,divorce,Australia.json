                "content": "Most women in Australia have a varying perspective on divorce. Generally, divorce is seen as a viable option for women who are facing unhappy or abusive marriages. Many women in Australia support the idea of divorce as they believe it offers them a chance to break free from an unsatisfying relationship and pursue personal happiness and well-being. However, opinions can differ among women based on cultural, religious, and personal beliefs, with some women viewing divorce as a last resort or a failure in maintaining a long-term commitment. It is important to note that individual attitudes towards divorce may vary widely, and there is no single sentiment that encompasses the views of all women in Australia."
