                "content": "The views on abortion among men in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may vary, as opinions on this topic can differ greatly among individuals. However, conservative cultural norms and religious beliefs generally influence many men in the country to firmly oppose abortion. These beliefs often emphasize the sanctity of life and the protection of unborn children. Consequently, most men in the Democratic Republic of the Congo tend to have negative attitudes towards abortion and may consider it morally unacceptable."
