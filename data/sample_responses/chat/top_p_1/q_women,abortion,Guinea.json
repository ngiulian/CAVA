Guinea is a predominantly Muslim country, and Islamic teachings generally consider abortion as forbidden under most circumstances. However, there may be diverging views among women based on personal, cultural, or religious beliefs. Some women in Guinea may support the idea of abortion to preserve a woman's health or in cases of rape, while others may strongly oppose it. It is crucial to recognize that individual perspectives on abortion can differ significantly and should be respected."
