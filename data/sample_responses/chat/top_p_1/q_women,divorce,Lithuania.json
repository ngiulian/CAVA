                "content": "Most women in Lithuania have a generally negative view of divorce. They perceive it as a last resort and believe in the importance of keeping a marriage intact, especially for the sake of their children. Women often strive to maintain the family unit and prioritize their roles as mothers and wives. Divorce is seen as a failure and carries a certain social stigma. However, there is a growing acceptance of divorce due to changing societal attitudes and increased exposure to Western influences."
