Idi Amin seized power in a military coup in 1971 and ruled the country with brutal actions until he was overthrown in 1979. Amin's regime was characterized by human rights abuses, political repression, economic mismanagement, and the expulsion of thousands of Asian Ugandans. This period had a profound impact on Uganda's history, politics, and society, leaving a lasting scar on the nation."
