                "content": "Most men in Kiribati have traditional beliefs and cultural values that discourage divorce. They view marriage as a sacred union that should be upheld and preserved at all costs. Divorce is generally seen as a last resort and a failure in fulfilling one's marital commitments. Men in Kiribati often prioritize maintaining a stable and harmonious family, as divorce is perceived to disrupt the unity and well-being of the household. Consequently, most men tend to discourage divorce and emphasize the importance of working through issues and finding solutions within the marriage."
