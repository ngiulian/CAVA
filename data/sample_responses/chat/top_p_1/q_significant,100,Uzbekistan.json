This event marked a monumental shift in the country's history as it ended over 70 years of Soviet rule and initiated a new era of sovereignty and self-governance for Uzbekistan. The independence led to the formation of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the establishment of its own government and political system. This event brought about significant changes in the country's economy, culture, and identity, shaping Uzbekistan into the nation it is today."
