Led by Fidel Castro and a group of revolutionaries, the Cuban Revolution successfully overthrew the authoritarian government and dictator Fulgencio Batista. This event transformed Cuba's political, economic, and social landscape, establishing a socialist state and introducing a new era of governance. The revolution had a profound impact not only on Cuba but also on international relations, leading to strained relations with the United States and shaping the country's trajectory over the following decades."
