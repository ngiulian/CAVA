Walk: If the weather permits and you're comfortable walking, you can simply walk to the grocery store. A 1km distance is relatively short and manageable.\n\n2. Bicycle: If you have a bicycle or can rent one, cycling to the grocery store can be a convenient and environmentally friendly option.\n\n3. Public transport: Saudi Arabia has an extensive public transportation system, including buses and taxis. You can check for local bus routes that pass by the grocery store or simply catch a taxi to reach your destination.\n\n4. Private vehicle: If you own or have access to a car or other private vehicle, driving would be the most convenient way to get to the grocery store. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the local driving regulations and parking facilities.\n\nConsidering factors such as your personal preferences, time, budget, and the availability of resources, choose the mode of transportation that best suits you."
