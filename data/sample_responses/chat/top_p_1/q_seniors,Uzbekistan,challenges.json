Many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions, which fail to cover their basic needs. Additionally, they often encounter difficulties in accessing quality healthcare due to rising healthcare costs and limited availability of medical facilities. Social isolation is prevalent among the elderly as they may lack support networks and opportunities for social interaction. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of support services specifically designed for seniors, such as home care assistance and community programs. These challenges collectively impact the well-being and quality of life of seniors in Uzbekistan."
