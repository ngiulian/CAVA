                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Georgia face include healthcare access and affordability, poverty and financial insecurity, limited transportation options, social isolation and loneliness, and insufficient support for aging and caregiving. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, especially those without insurance or with limited incomes. Poverty rates among seniors are relatively high, resulting in financial insecurity and difficulties meeting basic needs. Limited transportation options in rural areas make it challenging for seniors to access medical appointments, grocery stores, or social activities. Social isolation and loneliness are also prevalent due to factors like living alone, loss of friends and family, or limited social connections. Lastly, the lack of adequate support for aging and caregiving places a burden on seniors and their families, affecting their overall well-being and quality of life."
