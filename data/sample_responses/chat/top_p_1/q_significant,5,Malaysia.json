The ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, which had been in power since Malaysia's independence, was defeated by the Pakatan Harapan alliance led by Mahathir Mohamad. This event marked a significant shift in Malaysian politics, leading to the country's first change in government since its independence in 1957."
