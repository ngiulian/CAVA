                "content": "It is not possible to accurately generalize the views of most women in Israel regarding divorce as each individual may hold differing opinions influenced by personal, cultural, and religious factors. However, it can be noted that divorce rates in Israel have been increasing over the years, indicating that divorce is generally more socially accepted than in the past. Many women in Israel, like women in other countries, may see divorce as a means of escaping an unhappy or abusive marriage, aiming for personal freedom, and embracing a new beginning. However, it is crucial to recognize the diverse range of perspectives and experiences that women in Israel may have towards divorce."
