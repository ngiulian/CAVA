However, it is important to note that Djibouti is predominantly Muslim, and Islamic beliefs generally discourage abortion unless there are serious health risks to the mother. Additionally, Djibouti's abortion laws are restrictive, allowing the procedure only when the mother's life is at risk or in cases of fetal abnormality.\n\nSome women in Djibouti may hold conservative views influenced by their religious and cultural beliefs, considering abortion morally wrong and unacceptable. They might support the limited availability of abortions as stated by the law. On the other hand, there could be other women in Djibouti who believe in reproductive rights and advocate for more accessible and safe abortion services. These women might argue that women should have the autonomy to make choices regarding their own bodies and pregnancies, especially in cases of unwanted pregnancies or when it poses a threat to their physical or mental health.\n\nOverall, it is crucial to acknowledge that women's opinions on abortion in Djibouti are likely to be diverse due to various factors, and it would be an oversimplification to generalize the perspectives of \"most women\" in the country."
