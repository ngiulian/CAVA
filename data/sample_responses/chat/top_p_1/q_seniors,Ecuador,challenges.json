                "content": "Seniors in Ecuador face several challenges. Firstly, economic difficulties often arise due to insufficient retirement pensions, leading to financial hardships. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare expenses, medication, and basic necessities. Social isolation is another major challenge, as seniors may experience a lack of social support networks, leading to loneliness and decreased mental well-being. Additionally, accessing quality healthcare services, especially in rural areas, can be challenging for seniors. They may face difficulties in mobility and transportation, worsening their access to healthcare facilities. Finally, elderly abuse and neglect can pose a significant challenge, with some seniors being subjected to physical, emotional, or financial exploitation."
