After the end of World War II, Palau, along with other Micronesian islands, became a part of the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands administered by the United States. However, the journey towards independence spanned several decades with multiple referendums and negotiations.\n\nIn 1979, Palau originally signed a Compact of Free Association with the United States, which granted Palau self-government, economic assistance, and defense guarantees. However, the compact required ratification through a plebiscite, and due to concerns about the establishment of a U.S. military base, it was rejected in 1980.\n\nIt took several additional rounds of negotiations until a revised Compact of Free Association was agreed upon in 1993. This revised compact emphasized Palau's right to self-determination, environmental protections, and financial assistance from the United States. Finally, in a 1994 plebiscite, Palauans voted in favor of the Compact, and the Republic of Palau formally gained independence on October 1, 1994, marking a significant milestone in its history."
