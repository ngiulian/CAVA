Sweden had been a constitutional monarchy since 1809, but in 1975, a law was enacted to remove the King's political and executive powers, making Sweden a fully parliamentary democracy. This event marked a significant shift in the political landscape of the country and emphasized the importance of democratic principles in Swedish society."
