Many seniors struggle to make ends meet due to inadequate pensions and rising costs of living. Accessing quality healthcare and social assistance can be difficult, especially in rural areas. Seniors often experience loneliness and isolation, as their social networks shrink and they may lack opportunities for social engagement. Age discrimination in the workplace and society can limit their economic and social participation. Additionally, suitable housing options for seniors with specific mobility or health needs are often lacking."
