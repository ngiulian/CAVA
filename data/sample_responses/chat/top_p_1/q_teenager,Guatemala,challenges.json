                "content": "Teenagers in Guatemala face various challenges, including limited access to education and healthcare, poverty, gang violence, and high rates of teenage pregnancy. Many teenagers have to drop out of school due to financial constraints or lack of educational resources. Additionally, healthcare services, especially in rural areas, are often inadequate, leaving teenagers at risk of preventable illnesses and complications. Guatemala also suffers from high levels of poverty, leading to limited opportunities for teenagers to improve their situation and pursue higher education or decent employment. Gang violence and criminal activities pose a significant threat to their safety, with many teenagers coerced into joining gangs or becoming victims of violence. Furthermore, Guatemala has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in Latin America, resulting in early parenthood, limited opportunities for education, and increased vulnerability to poverty."
