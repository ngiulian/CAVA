On August 2, 1990, Iraq, under the leadership of Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait, leading to a seven-month-long occupation. The invasion triggered the Gulf War, an international military intervention led by a coalition of countries, including the United States. On February 26, 1991, Kuwait was liberated by the coalition forces, marking an end to the invasion. This event had major geopolitical implications, leading to shifts in power dynamics in the region and highlighting the importance of security and stability in the Gulf."
