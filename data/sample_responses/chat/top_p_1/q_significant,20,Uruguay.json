On April 10, 2013, Uruguay became the second country in Latin America, after Argentina, and the twelfth country in the world to fully legalize same-sex marriage. This event marked a major milestone for LGBTQ+ rights in the region and demonstrated Uruguay's commitment to equality and social progress. The legalization of same-sex marriage was seen as a significant step towards building an inclusive and tolerant society in Uruguay."
