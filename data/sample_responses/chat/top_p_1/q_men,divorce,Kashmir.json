                "content": "There is no specific consensus on the thoughts and opinions of most men in Kashmir regarding divorce, as attitudes can vary among individuals. However, some common perspectives can be observed.\n\nTraditionally, in the predominantly Muslim region of Kashmir, divorce was considered a last resort and was generally discouraged. Men often viewed marriage as a lifelong commitment, and divorce was seen as a social stigma that brought shame to the families involved. Consequently, many men viewed divorce as an undesirable outcome and were inclined to prioritize maintaining a stable and harmonious relationship.\n\nHowever, with changing times and increased awareness about individual rights, some men in Kashmir are becoming more open to the idea of divorce. Factors such as educational attainment, exposure to modern ideas, and influence of legal reforms have contributed to a shift in attitudes. Men, particularly from urban areas, are recognizing that divorce can be a necessary means to escape abusive or incompatible marriages.\n\nIt is important to note that opinions on divorce are diverse and can vary depending on factors such as age, education, socio-economic background, and levels of conservatism. While some men still hold traditional views on divorce, others might support it as a means to empower individuals, ensure personal happiness, and protect their rights."
