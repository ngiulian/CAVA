On December 1, 1948, following a brief but violent civil war, Costa Rican President Jos\u00e9 Figueres Ferrer abolished the country's military. This decision was a significant step towards peace, stability, and the dismantling of the military-industrial complex. Costa Rica became the first country in the world to constitutionally abolish its army, redirecting those resources towards education, healthcare, and social welfare programs. This event has had a profound impact on the country's identity, emphasizing its commitment to peace, democracy, and social progress."
