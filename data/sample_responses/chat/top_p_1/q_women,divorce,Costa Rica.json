They believe that women should have the right to make decisions about their own lives, including the decision to end a marriage. Women in Costa Rica also tend to support laws and policies that promote gender equality and protect women's rights during and after divorce. There is a growing acceptance of divorce as a normal aspect of modern life and a recognition that it can lead to personal growth and happiness for women."
