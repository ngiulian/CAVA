They believe it allows them to regain their independence and start a new chapter in their lives. They see divorce as a viable option to prioritize their own well-being and that of their children. However, there are also women who have a more conservative perspective on divorce. They may view it as a last resort or may have strong religious or cultural beliefs that discourage divorce. These women may prioritize societal expectations and value the sanctity of marriage, often advocating for reconciliation and working through marital problems. Overall, there is a diverse range of opinions among Jamaican women when it comes to divorce, reflecting various personal, cultural, and societal factors."
