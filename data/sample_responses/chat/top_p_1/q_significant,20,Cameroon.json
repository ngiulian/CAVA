It began in late 2016 and escalated in 2017 when English-speaking regions of Cameroon started protesting against perceived marginalization and discrimination by the French-speaking majority. The protests initially stemmed from concerns about the use of French in the education and legal systems of English-speaking regions. However, it soon developed into a full-blown conflict with both sides engaging in violence and human rights abuses. This ongoing crisis has led to a significant impact on the country's socio-political climate, economy, and the well-being of its citizens."
