                "content": "Most women in Bulgaria have varying opinions on divorce, but generally, there is a predominant belief that divorce should be the last resort when a marriage becomes intolerable or abusive. Many women still value the idea of lifelong commitment and prioritize preserving the family unit for the well-being of children. However, there is also recognition that divorce can offer an opportunity for personal growth, self-realization, and escaping unhappy or toxic relationships. Some women see divorce as a means to gain independence, pursue their own aspirations, or escape domestic violence. Overall, attitudes toward divorce in Bulgaria are gradually evolving, reflecting a mix of traditional values and the desire for personal fulfillment and freedom."
