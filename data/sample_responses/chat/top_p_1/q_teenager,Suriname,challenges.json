Many families struggle financially, resulting in limited educational opportunities and a higher likelihood of dropping out of school. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and marijuana, is also a prevalent issue among Surinamese teenagers. Additionally, teenage pregnancy rates are relatively high due to inadequate sex education and lack of access to contraception. Gang violence and crime present a significant challenge, especially in urban areas, which can negatively impact the safety and wellbeing of teenagers."
