Walking: Since it's just 1km away, walking could be a convenient and healthy option. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and be aware of the weather conditions.\n\n2. Bicycle: If you have a bicycle or can rent one, it can be a faster and more efficient way to reach the grocery store. Palau has scenic landscapes, so it could also be an enjoyable ride.\n\n3. Public transportation: Check if there are any local buses or shuttles that operate in the area. Find out the schedule and route, and take a bus that stops near the grocery store.\n\n4. Taxi or rideshare: If you prefer a more comfortable and convenient way to reach the store, you can call a taxi or use a rideshare app like Uber or Lyft if they are available in Palau.\n\nConsider factors like your physical ability, time, cost, and weather conditions when deciding which option suits you best."
