Walking: If you are comfortable walking, you can easily cover a 1km distance. Ensure to wear comfortable shoes and take necessary precautions like crossing roads safely.\n\n2. Bicycling: If you have a bicycle or can rent one, it can be a convenient and eco-friendly way to travel short distances. Cape Verde has some areas with bicycle-friendly infrastructure.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Check if there are any local buses, minibusses (known as \"aluguers\"), or shared taxis that operate in your area. Consider using these services if they pass by or have stops near the grocery store.\n\n4. Taxi: If you prefer a more direct and convenient option, you can hire a taxi. Taxis are generally available in Cape Verde, and you can find them at designated stands or book through a taxi app if available in your area.\n\n5. Personal vehicle or rental car: If you own a car or have access to a rental car, it provides flexibility and convenience, especially if you have to carry heavy groceries or want to make additional stops.\n\nRemember, when using any form of transportation, make sure to follow local traffic rules, keep valuables secure, and consider factors like time, cost, and your personal comfort."
