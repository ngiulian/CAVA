                "content": "Most men in Jordan hold a negative view towards divorce. They generally perceive it as socially and culturally unacceptable, as divorce is considered undesirable and a sign of a failed marriage. Men in Jordan often prioritize the preservation of the family unit and a commitment to their marriage. Divorce is often seen as a last resort or an option taken only under exceptional circumstances, such as instances of infidelity, abuse, or irreconcilable differences. Additionally, men may feel societal pressure to maintain a stable marriage due to the strong influence of traditional values, religious beliefs, and conservative social norms in Jordan."
