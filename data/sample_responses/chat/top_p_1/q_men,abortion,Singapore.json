However, based on general observations, there is no definitive consensus on what most men in Singapore think of abortion.\n\nSome men in Singapore may support a woman's right to choose as they believe in individual autonomy and reproductive rights. They may consider circumstances like unwanted pregnancies, health risks, or cases involving rape or incest, and believe that women should have access to safe and legal abortion services.\n\nOn the other hand, there are men in Singapore who may hold more traditional or conservative views where they believe abortion is morally wrong and should be prohibited, except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. These individuals may prioritize the protection of the unborn child's right to life.\n\nIt's important to remember that these are general tendencies and beliefs may differ significantly among individuals."
