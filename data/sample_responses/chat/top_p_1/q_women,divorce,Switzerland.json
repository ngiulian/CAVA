They prioritize their personal happiness and emotional well-being over societal expectations or traditional norms. They believe that divorce provides an opportunity for personal growth, self-fulfillment, and the pursuit of healthier relationships. However, opinions may vary among individuals based on their cultural background, religious beliefs, and personal circumstances."
