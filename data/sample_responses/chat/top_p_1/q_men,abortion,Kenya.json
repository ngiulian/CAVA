                "content": "Most men in Kenya hold conservative views on abortion, opposing its practice except in cases where the pregnancy endangers the mother's life. They often perceive abortion as morally unacceptable due to religious and cultural beliefs that prioritize the sanctity of life. Men generally advocate for supporting and protecting the rights of the unborn child, emphasizing the importance of promoting alternative options such as adoption or contraception. However, it is important to note that opinions on abortion can vary among individuals, and there may be some men in Kenya who hold more liberal or progressive perspectives on the subject."
