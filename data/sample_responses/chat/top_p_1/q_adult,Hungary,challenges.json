The country has been struggling with low wages and a high cost of living, making it difficult for many adults to make ends meet. Unemployment rates, especially among the youth, have been relatively high, posing a challenge in finding stable and well-paying jobs. Social inequality is also a concern, with marginalized groups experiencing discrimination and limited access to resources and opportunities. Additionally, Hungary has one of the fastest-aging populations in Europe, which creates challenges in terms of healthcare, pensions, and providing support for the elderly."
