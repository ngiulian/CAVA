This magnitude 6.3 earthquake caused significant devastation to the city of Christchurch, resulting in the deaths of 185 people and causing widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. The event had a profound impact on New Zealand, prompting major reconstruction efforts and a reassessment of the country's approach to building resilience against natural disasters."
