This event had a lasting impact on the country's political, social, and economic landscape.\n\nThe crisis began in September 2002 when a group of soldiers staged an uprising, splitting the country between the rebel-held north and the government-controlled south. This division remained largely intact for several years, leading to a de facto partitioning of the country.\n\nThe civil war caused immense suffering for the Ivorian population, with widespread violence, displacement of people, and human rights abuses. It also hindered economic development and stability, as key industries such as cocoa production, the country's main export, were severely impacted.\n\nAfter years of failed attempts at reconciliation, a peace agreement was signed in 2007, leading to a reunification process and disarmament of rebel groups. However, the effects of the crisis are still being felt in Ivory Coast, and the country is working towards long-term stability and national reconciliation."
