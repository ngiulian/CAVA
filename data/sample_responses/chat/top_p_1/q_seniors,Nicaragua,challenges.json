                "content": "The biggest challenges that seniors in Nicaragua face include limited access to healthcare, inadequate pension or retirement benefits, poverty, and social isolation. Many seniors lack access to quality healthcare facilities and services, which further worsens their health conditions. Additionally, a significant portion of the senior population in Nicaragua does not have access to sufficient pension or retirement benefits, leading to financial insecurity and poverty in their old age. Economic hardships often force seniors to live in poor conditions, lacking basic necessities such as food, shelter, and healthcare. Lastly, social isolation is a common challenge, as seniors may feel neglected and alone due to a lack of familial and community support systems."
