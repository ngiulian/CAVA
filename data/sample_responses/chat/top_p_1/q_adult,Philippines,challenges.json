One major challenge is poverty and lack of employment opportunities, which can affect their financial stability and access to basic needs. Many adults also struggle with inadequate education and skills training, hindering their chances of securing meaningful employment and advancing in their careers. Health concerns are another challenge, with issues such as limited healthcare access, inadequate sanitation, and rising healthcare costs. Additionally, adults in the Philippines face socio-political challenges, including corruption, political instability, and social inequality, which can affect their overall well-being and hinder their ability to participate fully in society."
