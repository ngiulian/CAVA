On March 19, 2019, Nazarbayev announced his resignation, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. He was succeeded by Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who was elected as the new president in June 2019. Nazarbayev's resignation was considered a historic moment as it marked the end of an era and initiated a transition of power in Kazakhstan."
