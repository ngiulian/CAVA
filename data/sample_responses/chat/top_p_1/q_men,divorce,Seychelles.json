They tend to view it as a breakdown of the family unit and believe that it negatively impacts children and society as a whole. Traditional gender roles and societal expectations often shape their views, with the idea that divorce goes against the cultural values of commitment, loyalty, and familial responsibility. Men in Seychelles generally prefer to work through marital issues and maintain stable relationships for the sake of their families."
