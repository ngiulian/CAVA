The conflict was characterized by extreme brutality, with widespread violence, mass killings, and atrocities committed by rebel groups, including the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).\n\nThe civil war was primarily driven by issues related to diamond mining, corruption, and power struggles. The RUF, led by Foday Sankoh, used terror tactics, including the recruitment and abduction of child soldiers, to gain control over diamond-rich areas and challenge the government.\n\nThe war not only resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of lives but also caused significant displacement and humanitarian crises. It further devastated the country's infrastructure, economy, and social fabric.\n\nUltimately, a peace agreement was signed in 2002, and the United Nations established the UN Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) to stabilize the nation. The aftermath of the civil war saw Sierra Leone embark on a path of recovery, reconciliation, and development, with subsequent democratic elections and efforts to rebuild the country."
