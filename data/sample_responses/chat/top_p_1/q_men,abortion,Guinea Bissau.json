                "content": "The views on abortion among men in Guinea Bissau vary, but there is a general sentiment that it is morally unacceptable and should be illegal. Most men in Guinea Bissau hold conservative social and religious beliefs, which shape their opinions on the matter. They often see abortion as a violation of the sanctity of life and believe that it goes against their cultural and religious values. Therefore, they tend to be against legalizing abortion and support restrictions on access to the procedure."
