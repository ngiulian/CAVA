                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Niger face include poverty and economic vulnerability, inadequate access to healthcare and social services, limited educational opportunities, and social isolation. Many seniors live in poverty and lack sufficient income to meet their basic needs, resulting in food insecurity and inadequate housing. Healthcare facilities and services are often scarce and inaccessible to seniors, leading to a lack of proper medical care and increased vulnerability to diseases. Seniors also face challenges in accessing social services and retirement benefits, reducing their ability to maintain a decent standard of living. Moreover, limited educational opportunities hinder their ability to acquire new skills and participate fully in society. Finally, social isolation and neglect are common issues as seniors often lack social support networks and may be marginalized by their communities."
