After the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Montenegro remained a part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and later Serbia and Montenegro. However, following a referendum on independence in 2006, Montenegro officially separated from Serbia and became an independent nation. This event marked a crucial step in Montenegro's path towards sovereignty and led to its recognition as a separate country by various international entities."
