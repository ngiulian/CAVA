After being occupied by the Soviet Union for nearly five decades, Lithuania declared its independence on March 11, 1990. This marked a significant milestone in the country's history, as it gained its freedom, paving the way for the establishment of a democratic state. The declaration of independence led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and solidified Lithuania's place as an independent nation once again."
