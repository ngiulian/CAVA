This Category 5 hurricane caused widespread destruction, resulting in loss of life, displacement of people, and significant damage to infrastructure. Ivan caused extensive flooding, landslides, and destruction across the island, particularly in the parishes of Clarendon, Manchester, and St. Elizabeth. The event served as a wake-up call for improved disaster preparedness and highlighted the vulnerability of the island to such extreme weather events."
