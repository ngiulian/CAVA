Some women consider abortion as a personal choice and believe women should have the right to decide on their reproductive health. Others may hold religious or cultural beliefs that oppose abortion, considering it morally wrong or unacceptable. The diverse cultural and religious backgrounds in Vanuatu contribute to differing opinions on this topic among women in the country."
