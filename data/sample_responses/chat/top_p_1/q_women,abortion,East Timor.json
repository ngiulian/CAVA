                "content": "Most women in East Timor have a relatively conservative view on abortion, considering it to be morally wrong or even a taboo subject. The predominantly Catholic nation holds strong religious beliefs, and these often shape their opinions on the matter. Many women hold the belief that life begins at the moment of conception and therefore regard abortion as a violation of this sacred belief. Furthermore, traditional values and cultural norms that prioritize family and motherhood influence women's perspectives, leading them to view abortion as socially unacceptable. Additionally, the limited access to comprehensive sexual education and healthcare services in the country further compounds the negative perception surrounding abortion. As a result, most women in East Timor are likely to oppose or hold a negative view on abortion."
