                "content": "Seniors in Hungary face a number of significant challenges. One major concern is financial hardship, as many older adults struggle to make ends meet on their pension or retirement savings, which are sometimes insufficient to cover basic expenses. Health issues are also prominent, with seniors often facing higher rates of chronic conditions and limited access to quality healthcare. Isolation and loneliness are pervasive challenges, particularly among those living alone or in rural areas with limited social support networks. In addition, there are concerns regarding digital exclusion, as many seniors lack access to technology or the necessary digital skills for online services and communication. Finally, the lack of age-friendly infrastructure, such as accessible transportation and housing options, presents difficulties for seniors in maintaining their independence and mobility."
