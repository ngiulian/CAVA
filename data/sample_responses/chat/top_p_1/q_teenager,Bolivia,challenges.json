Many teenagers struggle to receive a good education due to limited resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of trained teachers. As a result, obtaining valuable skills and knowledge becomes difficult, hindering their future prospects.\n\nAnother major challenge is poverty. A considerable portion of Bolivian teenagers live in poverty, which limits their opportunities in terms of healthcare, nutrition, and overall well-being. Poverty may also lead to high dropout rates, as teenagers are often forced to work to support their families instead of attending school.\n\nAdditionally, teenage pregnancy is a prevalent concern in Bolivia. Lack of comprehensive sex education and limited access to contraceptives contribute to high rates of teenage pregnancy. This issue often leads to disrupted education, increased health risks, and limited employment opportunities for young mothers.\n\nFurthermore, involvement in drug abuse and criminal activities is a significant challenge for some teenagers in Bolivia. Factors such as peer pressure, a lack of positive role models, and limited recreational activities contribute to this problem, posing risks to their physical and mental well-being.\n\nLastly, there is a lack of youth participation in decision-making processes and limited platforms for expressing their opinions and concerns.
