                "content": "Most women in Argentina generally have a positive view of divorce, seeing it as a means to pursue personal happiness and independence. They view divorce as a way to escape abusive or unhappy marriages and prioritize their own well-being and personal growth. Many women consider divorce as a way to seek equal rights and challenge traditional gender roles. This perspective has been influenced by changing attitudes towards marriage and increasing gender equality in Argentine society. However, it is important to acknowledge that individual perspectives may vary among women, influenced by factors such as cultural background, religion, and personal experiences."
