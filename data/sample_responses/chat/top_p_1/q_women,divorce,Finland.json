However, in general, a significant portion of women in Finland view divorce as a viable option if their marriage is unhappy or unfulfilling. There has been a cultural shift towards greater acceptance of divorce in recent years. Many women prioritize their personal happiness and well-being, and they believe that staying in an unhappy relationship can be detrimental to their overall quality of life. Women in Finland also value independence and gender equality, which can contribute to a positive attitude towards divorce. However, it is essential to recognize that individual opinions on divorce can differ depending on various factors, including personal beliefs, family values, and cultural background."
