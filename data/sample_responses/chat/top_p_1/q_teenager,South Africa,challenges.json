One major issue is the high rate of youth unemployment, which limits their prospects for a stable future and contributes to poverty and inequality. Additionally, many teenagers are exposed to violence and crime, with some becoming involved in gangs or substance abuse. South Africa also has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, and teenagers often lack adequate sex education and access to reproductive healthcare, leading to increased risks of infection and teenage pregnancies. Finally, the education system in the country faces many challenges, including overcrowded classrooms, insufficient resources, and disparities between wealthier and poorer areas, limiting opportunities for quality education."
