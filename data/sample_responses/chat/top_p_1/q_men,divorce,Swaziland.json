                "content": "Most men in Swaziland hold negative views towards divorce. They typically perceive divorce as a failure and a disgrace that brings shame to both the man and his family. Men often believe that divorce reflects a lack of commitment, endurance, and an inability to resolve marital conflicts. There is also a prevailing societal pressure on men to maintain traditional gender roles and responsibilities within marriage, leading them to view divorce as a betrayal of their duty. Overall, divorce is generally stigmatized and frowned upon by men in Swaziland."
