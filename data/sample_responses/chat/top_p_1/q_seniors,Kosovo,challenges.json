                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Kosovo face include limited access to healthcare services and affordable medicines due to low pensions and the high cost of living. Many seniors struggle with poverty as their pensions are often insufficient to cover their basic needs. Additionally, unemployment among seniors is high, making it difficult for them to find stable sources of income. Social isolation and loneliness are also common issues among seniors, as they may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Finally, there is a lack of adequate infrastructure and programs specifically tailored for seniors, leading to limited recreational and educational activities for them to participate in."
