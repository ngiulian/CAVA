The election took place on November 26, 2017, with initial results showing opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla leading the incumbent President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez. However, the release of subsequent vote counts raised allegations of electoral fraud and irregularities.\n\nThe crisis led to widespread protests, an official curfew, and a period of political instability. The Organization of American States (OAS) called for a new election to restore confidence in the democratic process. After weeks of tensions, negotiation, and international pressure, an agreement was finally reached that led to the formation of an OAS-backed commission to investigate the election irregularities.\n\nThis event highlighted democratic concerns regarding electoral transparency and tarnished the country's political image. It also drew attention to broader issues of corruption and governance in Honduras."
