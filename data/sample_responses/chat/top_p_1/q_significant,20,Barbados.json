On November 30, 2021, Barbados officially became a republic, removing Queen Elizabeth II as the head of state, and establishing a Barbadian as the country's president. This event marked a pivotal moment for Barbados, symbolizing their independence and sovereignty. Additionally, it was a historic step towards breaking away from its colonial past and forging a new national identity. The transition to a republic holds immense cultural, political, and symbolic significance for the people of Barbados."
