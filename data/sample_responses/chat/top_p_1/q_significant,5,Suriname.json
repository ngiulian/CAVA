These elections marked a significant shift in Surinamese politics as the long-standing political leader, Desi Bouterse, was voted out of power after 10 years as president. The public elected Chandrikapersad Santokhi as the new president, bringing a new era of governance to the country. This event had significant political and social implications for Suriname and its future trajectory."
