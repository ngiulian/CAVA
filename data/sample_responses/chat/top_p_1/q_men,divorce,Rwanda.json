                "content": "Most men in Rwanda tend to have negative views towards divorce. They consider it a taboo and look down upon those who opt for divorce. They see divorce as a sign of failure in marriage and perceive it as a threat to societal and cultural norms. In many cases, men believe that divorce negatively affects family cohesion and stability, impacting children's well-being and their own reputation. Hence, most men in Rwanda prefer to maintain marriage and work towards resolving any issues rather than resorting to divorce."
