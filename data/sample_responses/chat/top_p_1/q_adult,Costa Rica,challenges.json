Many adults struggle to find stable employment that provides decent wages, leading to financial difficulties and poverty. Access to affordable housing is another pressing issue, forcing some adults to live in inadequate conditions. Health care affordability and quality remain significant concerns for adults, with some facing limited access to medical services. Additionally, education and skill development opportunities may be limited for certain individuals, hindering their chances of advancement and career growth. Gender inequality and discrimination present additional challenges for women. Overall, the complex interplay of these factors poses significant challenges for adults in Costa Rica."
