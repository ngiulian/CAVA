                "content": "Seniors in Cameroon face several challenges, including inadequate healthcare services and facilities, limited access to basic social and economic resources, poverty and financial insecurity, social isolation, and age discrimination. The healthcare system often fails to meet the specific needs of the elderly population, resulting in limited access to geriatric care, specialized medical treatments, and elder-friendly facilities. Many seniors also struggle with limited financial resources, as pensions and retirement benefits are often insufficient, leading to poverty and financial insecurity. Additionally, social isolation is a significant concern as seniors may experience loneliness, neglect, or abuse. Age discrimination persists in employment opportunities and social integration, hindering the active participation of seniors in society. Overall, seniors in Cameroon face multifaceted challenges that significantly impact their quality of life."
