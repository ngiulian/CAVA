                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Germany in the past 5 years is the ongoing refugee crisis and the subsequent political and social implications. Starting in 2015, Germany experienced an influx of over a million refugees, primarily from war-torn countries in the Middle East and Africa. This humanitarian crisis had a profound impact on German society, sparking debates on immigration and integration, straining public resources, and leading to the rise of both far-right and far-left political movements. Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open the borders and her subsequent handling of the crisis has had long-lasting effects on German politics and society."
