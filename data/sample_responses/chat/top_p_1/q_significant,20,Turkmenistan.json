Niyazov, also known as Turkmenbashi, ruled the country with an iron fist since Turkmenistan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. He established a cult of personality and implemented policies that heavily centralized power.\n\nNiyazov passed away unexpectedly on December 21, 2006, leading to a period of political uncertainty in Turkmenistan. After his death, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, the then-Vice President, took over as Acting President until elections were held in February 2007. Berdimuhamedow won the presidential elections and has since continued to hold power.\n\nThis transition marked a significant shift in Turkmenistan's political landscape, although the authoritarian nature of the regime continued under Berdimuhamedow. Policies implemented by Niyazov, such as the focus on personality cult and the suppression of dissent, have still persisted to a certain extent.\n\nThe event of Niyazov's death and the subsequent transfer of power to Berdimuhamedow were significant as they marked a significant change in leadership, with Turkmenistan moving from one leader who had ruled for over a decade to another. However, it's important to note that the political structure and human rights conditions in the country"
