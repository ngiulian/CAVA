                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Fiji face include limited access to healthcare services, financial instability, social isolation, and age discrimination. Access to quality healthcare is a persistent challenge, particularly in rural areas, where limited resources and infrastructure restrict seniors' ability to receive proper medical attention. Financial instability is a concern, as many seniors rely on pensions or savings, which may not be sufficient to meet their needs, especially if they have health issues or dependents. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may often feel disconnected from their communities due to reduced mobility and a lack of social activities catered to their interests. Age discrimination is also a concern, as seniors may face stereotypes and prejudices, hindering their opportunities for employment or active participation in society. Overall, these challenges present obstacles to a fulfilling and dignified life for seniors in Fiji."
