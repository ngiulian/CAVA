They believe that individuals should have the freedom to leave a marriage if they are unhappy or if it no longer serves their needs. Men in France also consider divorce as an opportunity for personal growth and a chance to find new love and happiness. However, some men may still feel a sense of disappointment or loss associated with divorce, especially if there are children involved. Overall, the majority of men in France have a progressive attitude towards divorce and recognize it as a socially acceptable choice."
