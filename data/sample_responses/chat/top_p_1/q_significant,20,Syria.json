The conflict has had a profound impact on Syria and the region, resulting in immense loss of life, widespread destruction, displacement of millions of people, and a significant humanitarian crisis. The war initially started as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime but gradually evolved into a complex and multi-faceted conflict involving various factions, including rebel groups, the Islamic State (ISIS), and international actors. The war has had far-reaching consequences, affecting regional stability, global politics, and the lives of millions of Syrians."
