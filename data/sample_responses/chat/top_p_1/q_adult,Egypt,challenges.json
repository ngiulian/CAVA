Additionally, affordable housing is often scarce and many adults struggle to meet basic needs such as food security. Political instability and social unrest have further exacerbated these challenges, leading to a sense of insecurity and uncertainty among the adult population. Corruption and lack of transparency in government institutions also pose significant obstacles to individuals seeking opportunities for economic growth and a better quality of life."
