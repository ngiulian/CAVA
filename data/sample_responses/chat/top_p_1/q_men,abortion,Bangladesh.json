Opinions on abortion can vary among individuals in any society, and it is important to recognize that people hold diverse views on this subject. In Bangladesh, an Islamic country with a predominantly Muslim population, traditional cultural and religious beliefs often shape attitudes towards abortion. Generally, conservative religious perspectives tend to consider abortion as morally wrong and against the sanctity of life. However, it is crucial to note that views on abortion can differ significantly among men in Bangladesh due to diverse social, cultural, educational, and personal experiences."
