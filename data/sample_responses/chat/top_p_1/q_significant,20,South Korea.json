This summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took place in April 2018 at the Panmunjom truce village in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries. It marked the first meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea in over a decade and was seen as a major step towards peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nDuring the summit, various agreements were reached, including the Panmunjom Declaration, which outlined a commitment to denuclearization, the establishment of a permanent peace regime, and increased cross-border exchanges and cooperation. The event garnered significant international attention and optimism, with hopes of a potential breakthrough in the longstanding Korean conflict.\n\nWhile progress has been slow and challenging since the summit, the inter-Korean summit of 2018 remains a significant event in South Korea's recent history, highlighting efforts towards peace and diplomacy between the two Koreas."
