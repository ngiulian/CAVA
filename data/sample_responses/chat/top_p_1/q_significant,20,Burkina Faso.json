After ruling the country for 27 years, Compaor\u00e9 attempted to change the constitution to extend his term limit, sparking massive protests across the nation. The protests intensified, leading to the storming of the National Assembly and the President's resignation. This event marked a pivotal moment in Burkina Faso's history, reflecting the population's demand for democratic and accountable governance."
