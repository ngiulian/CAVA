This event marked an important milestone in the country's history, as Croatia became the 28th member state of the EU. The accession process involved comprehensive reforms and negotiations, aiming to align Croatia's legal framework, economy, and governance with EU standards. It signaled Croatia's integration into the wider European community, offering new opportunities and benefits while also posing challenges.
