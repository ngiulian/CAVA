Many men in Chile still hold traditional views regarding marriage and often view divorce negatively. They may see divorce as a social stigma and believe that it goes against the ideals of commitment and loyalty.

However, there is also a growing acceptance and understanding of divorce as societal attitudes evolve. Some men recognize divorce as a valid option for couples who are unhappy or facing irreconcilable differences. Overall, the perspective on divorce among men in Chile includes a mix of traditional and progressive views, which are influenced by cultural, societal, and individual factors."
