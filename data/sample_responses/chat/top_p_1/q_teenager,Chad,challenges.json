                "content": "Teenagers in Chad face several significant challenges. One major challenge is limited access to quality education, with a high number of teenagers being unable to attend school or dropping out due to factors like poverty, lack of infrastructure, and cultural norms. This hampers their prospects for a better future and personal growth.\n\nAnother challenge is the prevalence of child marriage, particularly for girls. Many teenagers, especially girls, are forced into early marriages, which negatively impact their health, education, and overall well-being. Early marriages often lead to increased risks of poverty, limited autonomy, and early pregnancies, which can perpetuate a cycle of poverty and further restrict opportunities for personal development.\n\nAdditionally, teenagers in Chad face health challenges, including inadequate healthcare services, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, and high rates of infectious diseases. Malnutrition is a considerable issue, with a significant number of teenagers suffering from stunting and other nutrition-related health problems, making them more susceptible to illnesses.\n\nFurthermore, conflict and displacement pose challenges for teenagers in Chad. In regions affected by insecurity, teenagers are exposed to violence, displacement, and disruption of their education, making it challenging to build stable lives and futures. Limited opportunities for vocational training and employment exacerbate the difficulties faced by teenagers in finding employment and economic stability.\n\nOverall, the biggest challenges for teenagers in Chad include limited access to education, child marriage, health issues, conflict, and displacement, which significantly impede their personal development and future prospects."
