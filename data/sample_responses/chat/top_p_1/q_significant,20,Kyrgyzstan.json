Also known as the \"Second Kyrgyz Revolution,\" it was a series of mass protests and demonstrations that led to the overthrow of President Askar Akayev's government and marked the first peaceful regime change in Central Asia. The revolution was a response to widespread corruption, authoritarian rule, and allegations of fraudulent parliamentary elections. The popular uprising resulted in the formation of an interim government and the election of a new president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev. This event had a profound impact on Kyrgyzstan's political landscape and set the stage for subsequent political developments in the country."
