They tend to view it as a threat to the traditional family structure and believe that it goes against their cultural and religious values. Men often prioritize the preservation of their marriages and see divorce as a sign of failure or a lack of commitment. They may also hold societal and cultural norms that emphasize the importance of staying together for the sake of children and overall stability."
