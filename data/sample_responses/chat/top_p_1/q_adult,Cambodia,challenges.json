Many adults struggle to make ends meet due to low wages and a high cost of living. Education is often inaccessible or of poor quality, limiting their ability to pursue better job opportunities. Inadequate healthcare infrastructure and limited access to quality healthcare services contribute to health issues and high mortality rates. The country also faces political instability, corruption, and a lack of governance, which hinders development and economic growth, further exacerbating the challenges faced by adults in Cambodia."
