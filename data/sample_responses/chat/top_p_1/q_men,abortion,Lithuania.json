However, it can be said that the topic of abortion in Lithuania tends to be controversial and often associated with strong religious and cultural beliefs. While some men in Lithuania may support a woman's right to choose and believe in safe and legal access to abortion, others may hold more traditional or conservative views regarding the sanctity of life and believe that abortion should be restricted or even prohibited. Public opinion surveys have indicated that attitudes towards abortion in Lithuania vary, and it is essential to recognize the diversity of perspectives within the country."
