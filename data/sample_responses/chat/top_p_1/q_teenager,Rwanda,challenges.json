The country's education system still struggles with overcrowded classrooms, high dropout rates, and inadequate infrastructure, affecting the quality of education available to teenagers. Poverty remains a significant challenge, leading to limited access to basic needs, healthcare, and proper nutrition. Teenagers also face difficulties in finding employment due to a competitive job market and a lack of skills. Furthermore, gender inequalities persist, with girls experiencing higher rates of early marriages, teenage pregnancies, and limited educational and economic opportunities compared to boys."
