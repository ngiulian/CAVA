They often consider divorce to be a last resort and believe that marriage should be a lifelong commitment. Men in Bosnia and Herzegovina generally perceive divorce as a disruptive and negative phenomenon, as it goes against traditional values and societal norms. However, this perception may vary among individuals, and there is a growing recognition that divorce can be necessary in certain circumstances, such as in cases of domestic violence or unresolvable conflicts."
