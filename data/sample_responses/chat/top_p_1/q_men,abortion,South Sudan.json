                "content": "Most men in South Sudan generally hold conservative views on abortion. They believe that it is morally and religiously wrong, considering it as the termination of a human life. Many men in the country adhere to traditional cultural values and traditionally perceive pregnancy as a blessing and a sign of fertility. Consequently, they consider abortion as a violation of these values and often discourage women from seeking or opting for the procedure. Men often play a significant role in decision-making within the South Sudanese society, and their opinions on abortion may heavily influence a woman's choice or access to the procedure."
