Firstly, the country has been plagued by conflict and violence for decades, leading to widespread displacement, destruction of infrastructure, and loss of life. The ongoing insecurity and presence of armed groups make it difficult for people to live in stable conditions, affecting their safety and livelihoods. \n\nSecondly, access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and clean water is limited in many parts of the country. The healthcare system is insufficiently equipped and lacks essential resources, leading to high infant and maternal mortality rates. Similarly, educational opportunities are limited, with many adults lacking access to quality schools, resulting in low literacy rates and limited skills development.\n\nThirdly, economic hardship is a major challenge in the DRC. Despite being rich in natural resources, exploitation, corruption, and mismanagement have hindered economic development. As a result, many adults struggle to find stable employment, leading to high levels of poverty and income inequality.\n\nAdditionally, gender inequality is pervasive in the DRC, with women and girls facing significant obstacles in terms of education, employment, and access to decision-making positions. Gender-based violence, including sexual violence, is also prevalent, posing serious risks to women and their well-being.\n\nLastly, political instability and weak governance systems hinder the country's progress. Corruption, nepotism, and lack of accountability undermine public trust and hinder effective governance, exacerbating the challenges faced by adults in the DRC.\n\nOverall"
