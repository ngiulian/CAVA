                "content": "One of the most significant events that occurred in Lesotho in the past 5 years was the political crisis and subsequent resignation of Prime Minister Thomas Thabane in 2020. The crisis was triggered by allegations that Thabane was involved in the murder of his estranged wife, Lipolelo Thabane. This led to a power struggle within the ruling party and widespread protests demanding Thabane's resignation. Eventually, he stepped down in May 2020, making way for Moeketsi Majoro to become the new Prime Minister. This political turmoil had significant implications for Lesotho's governance and stability during that period."
