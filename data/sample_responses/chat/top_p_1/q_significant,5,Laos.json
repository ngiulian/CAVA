The dam, located in the southern province of Attapeu, broke due to heavy rains, leading to catastrophic flooding and displacement of thousands of people. The event resulted in the death of at least 71 people, with many others missing and presumed dead. It highlighted the potential risks associated with hydropower development in the country, leading to calls for increased safety standards and better disaster preparedness in the region."
