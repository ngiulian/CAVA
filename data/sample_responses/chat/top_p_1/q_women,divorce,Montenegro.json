                "content": "It is difficult to summarize the opinions of all women in Montenegro regarding divorce as perspectives can vary among individuals. However, as in many societies, there is a range of attitudes towards divorce among women in Montenegro. Some women may view divorce as a means to escape unhappy or abusive marriages and see it as an opportunity for personal growth and independence. They might consider divorce as empowering and believe it can lead to a better quality of life. However, other women may have cultural or religious beliefs that discourage divorce and emphasize the importance of maintaining the institution of marriage. Additionally, stigma and societal pressure can still exist, which might make some women hesitant to openly express their support for divorce, even if they personally believe in it. Therefore, the opinions of most women in Montenegro regarding divorce will largely depend on their individual circumstances, values, and experiences."
