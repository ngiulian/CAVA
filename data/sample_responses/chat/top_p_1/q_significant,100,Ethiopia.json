This event marked the end of a 17-year-long communist rule under the Derg regime and brought about significant political and social changes in the country. The EPRDF introduced a federal system, promoting regional autonomy and ethnic-based governance, and initiated various reforms aimed at modernizing the country's institutions. This major political shift had a lasting impact on Ethiopia's governance and policies, shaping the country's trajectory in the subsequent years."
