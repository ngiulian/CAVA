                "content": "The biggest challenges adults in Andorra face include limited job opportunities due to a small workforce and a primarily tourism-focused economy. The cost of living is relatively high, making it difficult for some adults to afford housing, healthcare, and education expenses. Additionally, Andorra has a complex tax system, which can be a challenge for individuals and businesses. Limited access to affordable childcare and long working hours can pose obstacles for parents trying to balance work and family life. Lastly, as Andorra is a landlocked country, it lacks direct access to sea ports, which can hinder trade and transport options for businesses."
