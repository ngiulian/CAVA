These men often adhere to traditional, religious or cultural values that prioritize the sanctity of life and emphasize the responsibility to protect the unborn child. They typically believe that abortion is morally wrong and should be prohibited, except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. These conservative views are significant in shaping Bolivia's laws and policies regarding abortion."
