The healthcare services in Qatar may not be easily accessible to seniors, especially those living in remote areas, which can hinder their overall well-being. Social isolation is also a concern as seniors may face difficulties in maintaining social connections and engaging in community activities. Financial insecurity can be an issue for seniors, particularly if they have limited or no retirement savings, making it challenging to meet their basic needs and afford healthcare expenses. Age discrimination in the job market can also limit opportunities for seniors who may wish to work or continue their careers."
