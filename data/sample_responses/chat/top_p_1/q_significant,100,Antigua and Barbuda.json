This event marked the end of more than 350 years of British colonialism in the islands. Antiguans and Barbudans celebrated this milestone with national pride, and it allowed the country to shape its own political, economic, and social future. Independence brought about a sense of self-governance and allowed the country to establish its own international relationships, develop its own national identity, and make decisions regarding its own governance. This significant event has since remained crucial in the nation's history and continues to shape Antigua and Barbuda's path toward progress and development."
