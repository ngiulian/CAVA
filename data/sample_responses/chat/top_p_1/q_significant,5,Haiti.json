On July 7, 2021, Mo\u00efse was killed during an attack on his residence in Port-au-Prince. This event shocked the nation and created political chaos and instability in Haiti. It led to a power vacuum and heightened tensions within the country, deepening the existing social, economic, and political crises. The assassination of President Mo\u00efse has had far-reaching consequences for Haiti's governance, security, and future trajectory."
