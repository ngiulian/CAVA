The conference was held in Tarawa, the capital of Kiribati, and brought together representatives from around the world to discuss the issues and challenges faced by small island developing states.\n\nAs one of the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change and rising sea levels, Kiribati used this conference as a platform to raise awareness about the urgent need for global action on climate change. The event highlighted the plight of low-lying island nations like Kiribati, which are at risk of submergence due to climate-induced sea-level rise.\n\nDuring the conference, Kiribati's President Anote Tong made passionate appeals, urging world leaders to take swift and decisive action to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This event helped to elevate the global conversation on climate change and increased international recognition of the existential threat faced by Kiribati and other similar nations.\n\nOverall, the hosting of the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States placed Kiribati at the forefront of the international climate change discourse and emphasized the urgent need for global cooperation to address the challenges faced by vulnerable island nations."
