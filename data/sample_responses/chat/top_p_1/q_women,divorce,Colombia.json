However, it is fair to state that women's perspectives on divorce in Colombia have been evolving over time. As in many societies, divorce was once stigmatized, and women faced social and economic difficulties as a result. However, as gender norms and women's rights have progressed, so have attitudes towards divorce.\n\nToday, many women in Colombia see divorce as a viable option if their marriages become unsatisfactory, unhealthy, or abusive. With the increasing emphasis on individual happiness and personal fulfillment, women are more likely to prioritize their well-being, independence, and equality within a marriage. They generally value the idea of having control over their lives and believe that divorce can liberate them from unhappy or toxic relationships.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there is still a degree of social stigma associated with divorce in certain conservative sections of society. Some women might face judgment or criticism, particularly from older generations or traditional communities, as divorce challenges traditional family structures. Financial concerns can also arise as women may face economic instability after a divorce, especially if they are the primary caregivers or do not have access to employment opportunities.\n\nOverall, while women in Colombia have become more accepting of divorce as a means of ending unhealthy or dissatisfactory marriages, individual opinions can vary significantly depending on personal circumstances, cultural backgrounds, and socio-economic factors."
