                "content": "Most men in Albania tend to have negative views on divorce. They believe that divorce should be avoided and regard it as a sign of failure in a marriage. Men often consider divorce as a solution only in extreme cases, such as domestic violence or adultery. There is a societal expectation for couples to maintain a strong and lasting union, prioritizing family stability and traditional values. Consequently, most Albanian men view divorce as a last resort option, preferring to work on overcoming issues in their marriages instead."
