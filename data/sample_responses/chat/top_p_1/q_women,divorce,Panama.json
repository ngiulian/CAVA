                "content": "Most women in Panama have generally become more accepting and open towards divorce in recent years. They view divorce as a viable option for individuals who are unhappy or trapped in unhealthy and abusive relationships. Women recognize the importance of their own well-being, freedom, and personal growth, and are increasingly willing to break societal norms and traditional expectations by seeking a divorce when necessary. However, it is important to note that views on divorce can still vary among individuals, and some women may continue to face cultural or religious barriers that impact their perception of divorce."
