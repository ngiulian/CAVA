Phosphate mining became a key industry for Nauru, bringing significant wealth and transforming the nation's economy. However, the intensive mining practices led to ecological damage, resulting in environmental degradation and the depletion of the island's natural resources. This event had far-reaching consequences, impacting Nauru's economy, environment, and overall development."
