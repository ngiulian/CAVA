Traditional and cultural values, as well as religious beliefs, heavily influence the majority's perspective on the matter. Most men in Liberia believe that life begins at conception and see abortion as morally wrong, often considering it as taking an innocent life. Additionally, societal norms and gender roles often contribute to the belief that women should prioritize motherhood and bear the responsibility of unintended pregnancies. Overall, while there may be some variations in individual opinions, the prevailing viewpoint among many men in Liberia leans towards opposition to abortion."
