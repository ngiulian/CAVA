This movement began in November 2018 as a response to a proposed fuel tax increase but later evolved into a broader demonstration against the government's economic policies, social inequalities, and President Emmanuel Macron's leadership. The protests, marked by mass demonstrations, clashes with police, and acts of violence, lasted for several months and had a considerable impact on French politics and public discourse. The movement highlighted social discontent and spurred discussions on issues such as income inequality, taxation, and government accountability."
