Ensure you have comfortable shoes, a reusable bag for your groceries, and consider the climate before heading out.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle, it can be a faster mode of transportation for covering short distances. However, make sure you have a secure lock as well to prevent theft.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Check if there are any local buses, minibuses (known as \"kombis\" in Zambia), or taxis that can take you to the grocery store. Inquire about their routes and timings from locals or at nearby transport stops.\n\n4. Carpooling: If you have a friend, neighbor, or colleague heading in that direction, you can ask if they can give you a ride or share a taxi with them.\n\nConsider the time of day, availability, and cost when choosing the best mode of transportation for your specific situation."
