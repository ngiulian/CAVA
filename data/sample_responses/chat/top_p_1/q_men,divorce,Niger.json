                "content": "Most men in Niger have a negative view of divorce. They generally consider it socially unacceptable and something that goes against their cultural values. Men in Niger tend to believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and divorce is seen as a failure, bringing shame upon both parties. They often prioritize the stability of the family unit and the preservation of societal norms over individual happiness or personal conflicts that may arise within a marriage. Divorce is generally seen as a last resort, and men typically value reconciliation and compromise in resolving marital issues."
