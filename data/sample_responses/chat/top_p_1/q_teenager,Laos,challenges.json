The country faces economic and infrastructural challenges that result in a shortage of schools, especially in remote areas, and lacking quality education opportunities for teenagers. In terms of healthcare, many teenagers in Laos struggle with limited access to proper medical services and reproductive health resources. Additionally, job opportunities are scarce, especially in rural areas, leading to unemployment and underemployment. Cultural expectations and societal pressures, such as early marriage and gender inequality, can also pose challenges for teenagers. Moreover, drug and alcohol abuse is a growing concern among the youth population in Laos, contributing to various social issues."
