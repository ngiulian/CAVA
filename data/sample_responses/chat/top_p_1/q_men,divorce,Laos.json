                "content": "Most men in Laos have a negative perception of divorce. They consider divorce to be disruptive and a source of shame and embarrassment, both for themselves and their families. Traditional values and societal expectations play a significant role in shaping their opinions, where marriage is perceived as a lifelong commitment and divorce is seen as a failure. Men in Laos often prioritize maintaining family harmony and preserving their reputation over seeking divorce, even in situations of unhappy or abusive marriages."
