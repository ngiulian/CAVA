However, it can be said that abortion remains a debated and sensitive topic in Latvian society, including among men. While some men may have a pro-choice perspective, supporting a woman's right to make decisions regarding her reproductive health, others may hold more conservative viewpoints and be opposed to abortion, emphasizing the sanctity of life. It is essential to recognize that personal beliefs and attitudes can differ, and the perspectives of men in Latvia on abortion are diverse."
