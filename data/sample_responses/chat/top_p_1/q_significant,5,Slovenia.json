It marked a significant political shift as the anti-establishment party, known as the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), led by Janez Jan\u0161a, emerged as the largest party in the National Assembly. The election resulted in a change of government, with Janez Jan\u0161a becoming the Prime Minister of Slovenia for the third time. This event had a notable impact on Slovenian politics and policies, as it brought a new direction and leadership to the country."
