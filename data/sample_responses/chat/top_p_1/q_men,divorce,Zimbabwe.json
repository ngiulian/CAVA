                "content": "Most men in Zimbabwe tend to have negative views towards divorce. They often view divorce as a shameful and disappointing outcome, as it goes against cultural norms that emphasize keeping the family unit intact. Men commonly perceive divorce as a personal failure on their part, associated with a loss of societal respect and the inability to maintain a stable marriage. Furthermore, divorce is often seen as causing significant financial hardships, particularly when it comes to fulfilling financial obligations to children and former spouses. Overall, most men in Zimbabwe tend to hold a traditional and conservative stance towards divorce, prioritizing the preservation of family unity and societal acceptance."
