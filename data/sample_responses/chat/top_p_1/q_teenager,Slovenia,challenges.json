The competitive education system places a significant burden on students, leading to high levels of stress, anxiety, and parental expectations. Mental health problems, such as depression and self-esteem issues, are prevalent among Slovenian teenagers, and access to adequate support and resources is often limited. Substance abuse, including alcohol and drug use, is also a concern, with peer pressure and societal norms influencing risky behaviors. Lastly, the limited availability of part-time jobs and internships poses a challenge for teenagers seeking employment and gaining practical skills."
