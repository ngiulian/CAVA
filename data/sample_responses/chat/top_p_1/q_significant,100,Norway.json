This attack, carried out by right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik, resulted in the deaths of eight people in a bomb explosion in Oslo, followed by a mass shooting on Ut\u00f8ya island that claimed the lives of 69 individuals, mostly teenagers attending a political youth camp. This tragic event had a profound impact on Norway, leading to reflections on issues of extremism, terrorism, mental health, and societal resilience. It elicited a strong national response focused on unity, empathy, and fostering inclusive democratic values."
