                "content": "Seniors in Zimbabwe face several challenges, such as limited access to healthcare services and inadequate financial support. Many seniors struggle with poverty, as pensions are often inadequate to cover their basic needs. Additionally, there is a lack of geriatric healthcare facilities, making it difficult for seniors to receive proper medical attention. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may not have strong social networks or face discrimination and neglect from their own families. Lastly, the political and economic instability in Zimbabwe affects seniors disproportionately, leading to further hardships in accessing essential resources and services."
