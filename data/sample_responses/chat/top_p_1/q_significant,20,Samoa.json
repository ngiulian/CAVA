The tsunami, triggered by an undersea earthquake, affected the entire country and caused widespread destruction and loss of life. The disaster resulted in the deaths of at least 149 people, injured hundreds, and displaced thousands of individuals. It caused significant damage to infrastructure, homes, businesses, and villages along the coastlines of Upolu and Savai'i islands. The 2009 Samoa tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters in the island nation's recent history and had a lasting impact on the affected communities."
