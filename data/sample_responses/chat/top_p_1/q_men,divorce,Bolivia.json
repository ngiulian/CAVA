They often view it as a socially unacceptable and morally wrong practice, primarily because of their conservative upbringing and traditionally patriarchal culture. Men tend to believe that divorce undermines the stability of the family unit and can have negative consequences for the children involved. As a result, they tend to prioritize maintaining marriage and staying together despite any problems or challenges they may face."
