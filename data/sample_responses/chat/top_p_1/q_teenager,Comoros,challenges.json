                "content": "Teenagers in Comoros face several challenges. One of the biggest challenges is limited access to quality education and educational resources. Many schools lack proper facilities, qualified teachers, and textbooks, hindering students' learning process.\n\nAnother major challenge is the high rates of unemployment and limited job opportunities. This often leads to frustration and hopelessness among teenagers, who face difficulties in finding meaningful employment to support themselves and their families.\n\nAdditionally, poverty affects a large number of teenagers in Comoros, making it challenging for them to meet their basic needs. Limited access to healthcare, clean water, and proper nutrition further exacerbates the situation, negatively impacting their physical and mental wellbeing.\n\nFurthermore, traditional cultural norms and gender roles can also pose challenges for teenagers, especially girls, as they might face pressures to conform to societal expectations rather than pursuing their own dreams and aspirations.\n\nLastly, lack of recreational and extracurricular activities contributes to boredom and limited personal growth opportunities. This can potentially lead teenagers towards engaging in risky behaviors such as substance abuse or early marriages.\n\nOverall, these challenges hinder the development and prospects of teenagers in Comoros, impacting their education, employment, health, and overall well-being."
