                "content": "Teenagers in Malta face several challenges, including limited educational opportunities, unemployment rates, substance abuse, mental health issues, and lack of recreational activities. The education system in Malta is often criticized for its limited vocational training options, leaving some teenagers struggling to find suitable career paths. Additionally, unemployment rates among young people are relatively high, making it difficult for teenagers to enter the job market. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drug use, is a concern among some teenagers, which can negatively impact their overall well-being. Mental health issues such as anxiety and depression are also prevalent and can be exacerbated by various factors, including academic pressures and social expectations. Lastly, there is a perceived lack of safe and engaging recreational activities for teenagers, leading to boredom and potential involvement in risky behaviors."
