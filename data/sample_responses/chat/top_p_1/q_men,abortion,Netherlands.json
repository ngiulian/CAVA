However, in the Netherlands, a majority of men tend to support a woman's right to choose and have access to safe and legal abortion services. The Netherlands has a progressive approach towards reproductive rights, and abortion is legally permitted under certain circumstances. Men in the Netherlands often prioritize a woman's autonomy and reproductive freedom, recognizing that decisions about abortion should primarily be made by the woman herself."
