In 2015, Costa Rica successfully relied solely on renewable energy sources such as hydropower, wind energy, geothermal energy, and solar power for its electricity needs, for a total of 299 days. This milestone demonstrated Costa Rica's commitment to sustainability and its efforts to combat climate change."
