However, in Belgium, divorce is generally seen as a socially acceptable option for couples whose marriages have irretrievably broken down. Women, like men, may view divorce as a means to end an unhappy or unhealthy relationship, seek personal fulfillment, or prioritize their own well-being and that of their children. Many women in Belgium may also perceive divorce as an opportunity for personal growth, independence, and the chance to build a better future. It is crucial to note that while individual opinions may differ, the prevalence of divorce in Belgian society suggests that a significant number of women find it a viable option for ending unsatisfactory marriages."
