The country has a large population, and providing employment opportunities for all can be a significant challenge. Many adults struggle with poverty, making it difficult to meet their basic needs. Access to quality education and healthcare is also a concern, particularly for those living in rural areas. Moreover, social inequality remains a challenge, with disparities prevalent in terms of income, opportunities, and access to resources, affecting adults from marginalized groups."
