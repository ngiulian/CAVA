                "content": "Most women in Belarus have a negative perception of divorce. They view it as an undesirable and last resort option for resolving marital problems. Women tend to prioritize stability and family unity, valuing the commitment and loyalty that comes with marriage. Divorce is seen as a social stigma and failure, often associated with emotional and financial hardships for women. Many women believe in working through difficulties and maintaining the family unit, even if it means sacrificing personal happiness. However, there may be some variations in individual opinions and attitudes towards divorce based on different cultural and generational factors."
