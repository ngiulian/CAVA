Rousseff, the first female president of Brazil, was accused of fiscal mismanagement and faced widespread public anger due to a severe economic recession and corruption scandals in the country. The impeachment process was highly controversial and led to a political crisis in Brazil. Rousseff was ultimately removed from office, and Michel Temer assumed the presidency. This event had a profound impact on Brazilian politics, demonstrating the country's struggles with corruption and its effects on governance."
