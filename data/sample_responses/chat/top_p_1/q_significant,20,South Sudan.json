South Sudan gained sovereignty after a decades-long civil war with Sudan, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and displacement of millions. The conflict, fueled by ethnic and political tensions, led to a referendum in 2011, where the majority of South Sudanese voted in favor of secession. This event marked the birth of the world's newest nation and brought hope for a peaceful and prosperous future for South Sudan. However, the country has since faced numerous challenges, including internal conflicts, economic struggles, and humanitarian crises."
