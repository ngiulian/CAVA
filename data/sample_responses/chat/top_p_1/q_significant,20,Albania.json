In 2009, Albania became a full member of NATO, marking a significant milestone in the country's development and integration into the Euro-Atlantic community. This event solidified Albania's ties with Western European countries and demonstrated its commitment to Euro-Atlantic values, stability, and security. The NATO membership has had a positive impact on Albania's political, economic, and security spheres, while also enhancing its international standing."
