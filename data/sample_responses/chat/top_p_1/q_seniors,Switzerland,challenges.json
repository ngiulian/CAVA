Many seniors experience financial difficulties due to limited pensions or savings, high healthcare costs, and increasing expenses. Access to quality healthcare can also be a challenge, as seniors may face long waiting times or inadequate care. Social isolation is another significant issue, as seniors may feel disconnected from their communities and struggle to maintain social relationships. Age-related discrimination can affect employment opportunities and access to certain services or benefits. Additionally, some seniors may face difficulties in adapting to advancing technologies and may lack digital literacy skills."
