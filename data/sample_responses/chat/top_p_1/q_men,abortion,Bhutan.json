However, it can be said that like in many other societies, attitudes towards abortion in Bhutan vary among men based on their personal beliefs, cultural and religious backgrounds, and socio-economic factors. Some men may hold conservative views and consider abortion morally wrong and unacceptable. They may prioritize the preservation of life and believe that a fetus deserves protection. On the other hand, there are also men who support a woman's right to make decisions about her own body and reproductive healthcare. They may advocate for the availability of safe and legal abortion options, especially in cases of health risks, psychological distress, or unwanted pregnancies. Consequently, men in Bhutan likely hold a range of opinions on abortion, reflecting the diversity of perspectives within the society."
