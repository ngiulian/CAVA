Coordinated attacks across the city by ISIS terrorists left 130 people dead and hundreds more injured. This incident had a profound impact on France and the world, leading to increased security measures, debates on immigration policies, and an intensified fight against terrorism. It also served as a reminder of the global threat posed by extremist ideologies and the ongoing challenge of ensuring public safety."
