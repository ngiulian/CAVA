Additionally, access to quality healthcare and education may be a concern for some individuals. Corruption and political instability are also challenges that can impact the overall well-being and trust in public institutions. Lastly, the country's aging population, inadequate pension system, and the need for affordable housing are among the challenges that adults in Slovakia may encounter."
