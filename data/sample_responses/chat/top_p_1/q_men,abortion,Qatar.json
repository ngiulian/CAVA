However, in Qatar, a conservative Islamic country, abortion is generally viewed as morally and culturally unacceptable by most men. Islamic teachings generally prohibit abortion except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. The majority of men in Qatar tend to adhere to these religious and cultural beliefs and hold a strong pro-life stance, considering abortion as a violation of the sanctity of life."
