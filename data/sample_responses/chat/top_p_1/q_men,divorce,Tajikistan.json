                "content": "Most men in Tajikistan have traditional views on divorce and generally disapprove of it. They believe that marriage is a sacred bond and should ideally last a lifetime. Divorce is considered a last resort and is often seen as a failure of the husband to maintain a stable and harmonious family. Men consider divorce to be socially stigmatizing for both partners, as it brings shame and embarrassment to the family. Consequently, most men in Tajikistan value commitment and work towards resolving conflicts or challenges within their marriages rather than opting for divorce."
