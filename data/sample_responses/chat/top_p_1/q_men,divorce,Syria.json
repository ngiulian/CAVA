Syrians, like people from various cultures, have diverse opinions and attitudes towards divorce. Some may perceive divorce as a last resort or a social taboo, while others may view it as a valid solution to marital issues. The perception of divorce can also depend on factors such as educational background, religious beliefs, regional differences, and personal experiences. It is essential to recognize the individuality of perspectives within any society."
