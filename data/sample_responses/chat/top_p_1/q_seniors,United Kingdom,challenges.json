Poverty and financial insecurity: Some seniors struggle with low pensions, rising living costs, limited job opportunities, and inadequate savings, leading to financial insecurity and potential poverty.\n\n3. Health issues: Age-related health conditions, such as chronic diseases, mobility limitations, and mental health issues, pose significant challenges for seniors and can affect their overall well-being and quality of life.\n\n4.
