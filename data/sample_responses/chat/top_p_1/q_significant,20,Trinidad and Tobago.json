On May 24, 2010, the People's Partnership coalition, led by the United National Congress (UNC), won a landslide victory, ending the 20-year rule of the People's National Movement (PNM). Kamla Persad-Bissessar became the country's first female Prime Minister. This marked a significant shift in the country's political landscape and brought about new policies and initiatives in various areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development."
