These men typically perceive marriage as a lifelong commitment and hold strong cultural and religious values that discourage divorce. They prioritize stability and the preservation of the family unit, and therefore view divorce as a last resort or a failure to fulfill duties as a husband and father. Consequently, many men in El Salvador strive to maintain and salvage their marriages, even in the face of difficulties or unhappiness."
