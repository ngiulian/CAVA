One significant challenge is limited educational opportunities, with inadequate resources and facilities in some schools. Additionally, high rates of teenage pregnancy and early marriage can hinder academic progress and limit future prospects for young individuals. Social pressures also play a role, as many teenagers struggle to strike a balance between traditional cultural values and modern influences. Limited access to healthcare, including mental health services, can further compound their challenges. Moreover, unemployment and limited job prospects contribute to the difficulties teenagers face in transitioning into adulthood and securing a stable future."
