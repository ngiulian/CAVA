However, based on available information, it can be said that the majority of women in Armenia hold conservative views on abortion. Abortion is generally frowned upon, and many consider it morally wrong or sinful. Armenia, being a predominantly religious country with strong ties to the Armenian Apostolic Church, influences such beliefs. Consequently, women in Armenia often face stigma and social pressure if they choose to undergo abortion. However, this does not mean that all women share this perspective as attitudes can differ based on personal circumstances, age, education, and other factors."
