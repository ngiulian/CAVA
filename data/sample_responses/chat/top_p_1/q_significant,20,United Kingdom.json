This referendum resulted in the decision for the UK to leave the European Union (EU), after being a member for over four decades. The vote to leave, often referred to as \"Brexit,\" had wide-ranging political, economic, and social consequences within the UK and across the globe. It led to changes in leadership, deep divisions among the population, and ongoing negotiations to shape a new relationship between the UK and the EU. The impact of Brexit continues to be felt in various aspects of British society, making it a highly significant event in recent UK history."
