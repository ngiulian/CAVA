On August 5, 2019, the Indian government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the scrapping of the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir, which had granted the region a degree of autonomy. This move led to significant political, social, and economic consequences in the region, and it sparked widespread protests, security clampdowns, and communications blackout. The revocation of Article 370 has been a highly contentious and polarizing decision, deeply impacting the socio-political dynamics of Kashmir and the lives of the people in the region."
