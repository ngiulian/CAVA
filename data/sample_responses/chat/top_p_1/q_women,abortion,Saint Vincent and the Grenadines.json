However, it is generally observed that there is a significant amount of social and cultural conservatism in the country, with strong religious influences. As a result, there tends to be a greater opposition to abortion, as it conflicts with traditional values and beliefs surrounding the sanctity of life. Discussions and debates surrounding the topic often highlight the moral and ethical concerns related to terminating pregnancies. Nonetheless, it is important to note that personal views on abortion can vary among women, and there might be a range of opinions and perspectives within the population."
