However, data suggests that attitudes towards abortion in Thailand, including among men, are generally more accepting compared to some other countries.\n\nMany men in Thailand tend to hold moderately progressive or neutral views on abortion. They understand that it is ultimately a decision that should be made by the woman and her partner, considering various factors such as financial stability, personal circumstances, and health risks. They recognize a woman's right to make choices about her own body.\n\nThailand has relatively liberal abortion laws compared to other Asian countries, allowing access to safe and legal abortions in a variety of circumstances, including when the pregnancy poses a risk to the woman's physical or mental health or in cases of rape or incest. This legal framework, combined with the influence of Buddhist philosophy - the predominant religion in Thailand - which emphasizes compassion and personal choice, has contributed to a more accepting attitude toward abortion.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to remember that opinions can vary on an individual basis, and conservative perspectives may also exist among some men in Thailand due to cultural and religious beliefs. Societal views can also be shaped by factors such as education, age, and personal experiences. Therefore, it is essential to approach this topic with sensitivity and not generalize the opinions of all men in Thailand."
