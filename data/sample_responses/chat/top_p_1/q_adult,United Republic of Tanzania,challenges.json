Poverty is widespread, especially in rural areas, leading to lack of basic necessities and limited opportunities for economic growth. Unemployment rates are high, particularly among the youth, resulting in a lack of financial stability and social well-being. Limited access to quality education is a significant issue, with insufficient infrastructure, low literacy rates, and educational inequalities between urban and rural areas. Inadequate healthcare infrastructure poses challenges, including a lack of medical facilities, access to essential medicines, and healthcare professionals. Gender inequality persists in various forms, including limited educational and employment opportunities, early marriages, and domestic violence. Political instability, although relatively stable in recent times, has historically impacted development and governance in the country."
