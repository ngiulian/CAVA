                "content": "Most women in Belarus have a negative view of abortion. They tend to see it as a sensitive and complex issue that involves ethical and moral considerations. Many women believe that life begins at conception and consider abortion as the termination of that life. They view it as a last resort option for cases involving serious health risks to the mother or severe fetal abnormalities. Additionally, religious and cultural beliefs influence their stance, as Belarus has a predominantly Orthodox Christian population. However, it's important to note that individual opinions may vary, and there might be some women who hold different views on abortion in Belarus."
