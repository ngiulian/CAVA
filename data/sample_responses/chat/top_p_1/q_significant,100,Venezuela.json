Ch\u00e1vez's presidency marked a significant shift in Venezuelan politics as he implemented a series of socialist policies and established what he called the \"Bolivarian Revolution.\" Under his government, Ch\u00e1vez implemented land reforms, nationalized industries, expanded social welfare programs, and shifted Venezuela's foreign policy towards anti-imperialist and anti-US stances. This period also saw the consolidation of power by Ch\u00e1vez's political party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). While Ch\u00e1vez's supporters viewed him as a champion of the poor and marginalized, his policies also faced criticism for exacerbating economic instability, leading to deep divisions within Venezuelan society. Ch\u00e1vez passed away in 2013, but his legacy and the transformation he brought to Venezuelan politics continue to shape the country's trajectory."
