However, Switzerland has a liberal approach towards reproductive rights, and abortion is legally permitted within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy under certain conditions. Hence, many women in Switzerland likely support a woman's right to choose and have access to safe and legal abortion services. Additionally, there are also active pro-choice advocacy groups in the country that work towards safeguarding women's reproductive rights. However, it is important to recognize that individual opinions can differ, and there may be women in Switzerland who hold different beliefs or reservations about abortion based on their own personal values, religious backgrounds, or cultural perspectives."
