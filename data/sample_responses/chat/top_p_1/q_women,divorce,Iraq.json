                "content": "It is challenging to provide a comprehensive summary of what most women in Iraq think of divorce as perspectives can vary greatly among individuals. Generally, views on divorce in Iraq are influenced by several factors, including cultural norms, religious beliefs, societal pressures, and personal experiences. Some Iraqi women see divorce as a necessary option to escape unhappy or abusive marriages, while others may view it as a last resort due to the social stigma attached to it. Conservative cultural and religious values can sometimes discourage divorce, with societal expectations often pressuring women to prioritize maintaining familial unity. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that individual women in Iraq may have diverse opinions and experiences regarding divorce."
