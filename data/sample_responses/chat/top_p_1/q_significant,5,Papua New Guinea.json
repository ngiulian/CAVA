This event brought together leaders and delegates from 21 Pacific Rim member economies, including the United States, China, Russia, and Australia. It was a highly anticipated event for Papua New Guinea as it showcased the country's ability to host a major international conference.\n\nThe APEC summit served as a platform for Papua New Guinea to promote trade and investment opportunities, as well as to increase its global visibility. However, the event also faced challenges, including logistical difficulties and financial strain on the country's economy. Nonetheless, the summit provided an opportunity for Papua New Guinea to engage with global leaders and strengthen regional cooperation."
