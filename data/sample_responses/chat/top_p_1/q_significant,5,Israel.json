The Abraham Accords were a series of normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco. This event marked a significant shift in regional diplomacy, as it provided a framework for diplomatic relations, economic cooperation, and cultural exchanges between Israel and these Arab nations. The agreements also indicated a growing recognition and acceptance of Israel in the Arab world, which had previously been isolated in the region."
