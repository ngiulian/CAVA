                "content": "Most women in Moldova have a negative perception of divorce. They believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and view divorce as a last resort. Women in Moldova often prioritize family values and put in efforts to preserve their marriages, often seeking solutions to problems through communication and compromise. Divorce is commonly seen as a failure and can be stigmatized by society, leading women to avoid it if possible. While some women may consider divorce in cases of abuse, infidelity, or incompatible relationships, the general mindset is that divorce should be avoided, and great efforts should be made to work on a marriage."
