                "content": "One of the biggest challenges teenagers in Latvia face is the lack of opportunities for personal and professional development. The education system often fails to provide practical skills and focus on individual talents, limiting their potential. Additionally, unemployment rates among young people are high, making it difficult for teenagers to find meaningful work and gain financial independence.\n\nTeenagers in Latvia also face social pressures and issues related to mental health. Peer pressure, bullying, and a desire to fit in can lead to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem. Moreover, there is a lack of support and awareness around mental health, leading many teenagers to struggle silently with anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.\n\nAnother challenge for teenagers in Latvia is the exposure to harmful substances. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and tobacco, is prevalent among teens, leading to health problems and detrimental effects on their well-being.\n\nOverall, these challenges pose significant obstacles for teenagers in Latvia, hindering their personal growth, academic success, and overall happiness."
