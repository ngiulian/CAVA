                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Tunisia in the past 100 years is the Tunisian Revolution, also known as the Jasmine Revolution, which took place in 2010 and 2011. This event marked the beginning of the Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy and anti-government uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa. The Tunisian Revolution started in December 2010 after the self-immolation of a street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, in protest against police harassment and economic hardships. This incident sparked large-scale protests and demonstrations against the oppressive regime of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The movement quickly gained momentum, leading to nationwide protests demanding political freedoms, economic reforms, and an end to corruption. Eventually, on January 14, 2011, President Ben Ali was forced to flee the country, ending his 23-year authoritarian rule. The Tunisian Revolution had a profound impact not only on Tunisia but also inspired similar uprisings in several other Arab countries, making it a significant event in the region's recent history. Additionally, it led to the initiation of political reforms, including the drafting of a new constitution, free elections, and the establishment of a democratically elected government in Tunisia."
