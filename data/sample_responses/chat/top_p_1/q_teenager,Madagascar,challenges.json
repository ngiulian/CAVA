They also face social issues like early marriages and pregnancies, gender inequalities, and exploitation. Furthermore, natural disasters and climate change exacerbate these challenges, leading to food insecurity and displacement. Overall, the combination of economic, social, and environmental factors presents significant obstacles for teenagers in Madagascar."
