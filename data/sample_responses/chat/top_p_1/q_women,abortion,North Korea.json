However, it is essential to consider the context of North Korean society, where access to information, freedom of expression, and open discussions on sensitive topics are limited. \n\nThe North Korean government strictly controls and censors information, which may influence societal perceptions and beliefs. It is likely that there are diverse opinions among women in the country, influenced by various factors such as personal values, family dynamics, societal norms, and the lack of reproductive rights education. These factors may shape individual beliefs and attitudes towards abortion, but due to limited information, it is challenging to generalize the views of the majority."
