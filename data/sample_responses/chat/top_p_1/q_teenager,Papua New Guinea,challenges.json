                "content": "Teenagers in Papua New Guinea face numerous challenges, including limited access to education, high rates of poverty, inadequate healthcare services, gender inequality, and exposure to societal violence. Many teenagers in remote areas lack access to quality education due to the lack of schools and proper educational infrastructure. This hinders their prospects for a better future and limits their opportunities for personal growth.\n\nPoverty is a significant challenge for teenagers in Papua New Guinea, as a considerable portion of the population lives below the poverty line. Limited access to essential services, such as clean water, electricity, and sanitation, adversely affects the well-being and development of teenagers, making it difficult for them to break the cycle of poverty.\n\nHealthcare services, particularly in rural areas, are often inadequate, leaving teenagers vulnerable to various health issues, including high infant and maternal mortality rates, malnutrition, malaria, and other preventable diseases. The lack of awareness and access to sexual and reproductive health services also poses challenges, as teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections are prevalent.\n\nGender inequality is another significant challenge faced by teenagers in Papua New Guinea. Girls often face discrimination in accessing education and are at a higher risk of experiencing gender-based violence. Early marriages, domestic violence, and limited economic opportunities further compound the challenges faced by teenage girls.\n\nTeenagers are also exposed to high levels of societal violence, including gang-related violence, tribal conflicts, and criminal activities, which pose serious threats to their safety and well-being. Lack of legal protection and limited law enforcement exacerbate this"
