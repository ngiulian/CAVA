This event marked the end of foreign rule and the establishment of Mongolia as an independent country.\n\nDuring this revolution, led by Mongolian revolutionaries and supported by Bolshevik forces from Soviet Russia, the Mongolian people successfully overthrew the Chinese occupation and declared the Mongolian People's Republic. They established a socialist government and began implementing various political, social, and economic reforms.\n\nThe revolution had far-reaching impacts on Mongolian society, including the nationalization of industry and land, the introduction of educational and healthcare reforms, and the implementation of collectivized agriculture. It also led to closer ties with Soviet Russia, which influenced Mongolia's political and economic trajectory for several decades.\n\nOverall, the Mongolian Revolution of 1921 is considered a turning point in the country's history as it shaped the course of its political, social, and economic development throughout the 20th century and beyond."
