Additionally, both countries committed to strengthening economic cooperation, implementing energy and infrastructure projects, and facilitating the movement of people and goods.\n\nThe Washington Agreement was seen as a significant step towards resolving long-standing tensions between Kosovo and Serbia, which have been at odds since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008. This agreement was hailed as a breakthrough and received international recognition as an important development in the region's stability and peace process."
