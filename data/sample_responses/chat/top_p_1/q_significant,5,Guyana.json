In 2015, ExxonMobil made a large oil discovery in the Stabroek Block off the coast of Guyana. Further exploration and subsequent discoveries have revealed that the country possesses significant oil reserves, estimated to contain billions of barrels. This discovery has the potential to transform Guyana's economy, leading to expectations of increased revenues and investment in the country. As a result, Guyana has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world."
