In the years leading up to 2008, Iceland experienced rapid economic growth, primarily driven by an expansion in the banking sector. However, unsustainable lending practices, inflated asset values, and a global financial crisis led to the collapse of Iceland's three largest banks. \n\nThis crisis had a profound impact on the country's economy and society. Iceland's currency plummeted, unemployment soared, and many people lost their homes and life savings. The government was ultimately forced to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilize the economy. The financial collapse had long-lasting effects on Iceland, including changes in economic policies, increased regulation, and a wave of public demonstrations demanding political and economic reform."
