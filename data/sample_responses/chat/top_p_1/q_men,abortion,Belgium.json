However, Belgium is known for its progressive stance on reproductive rights, including access to legal abortion. The majority of men in Belgium likely support a woman's right to choose and respect her autonomy in making decisions about her own body. They may believe that women should have access to safe and legal abortion services, as well as adequate support and information regarding reproductive health. It is essential to recognize that individual opinions and beliefs on this topic can differ and that this summary does not represent the views of all men in Belgium."
