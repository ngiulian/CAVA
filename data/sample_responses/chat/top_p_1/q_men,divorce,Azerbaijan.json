                "content": "Most men in Azerbaijan generally hold negative views about divorce. They perceive divorce as a failure and believe that it undermines the sanctity of marriage and family, reflecting traditional values deeply rooted in the society. Men in Azerbaijan often prioritize maintaining a stable and harmonious family unit and view divorce as disruptive to their social and personal lives. They may feel a sense of social stigma and shame associated with divorce, particularly in more conservative communities. Despite these views, there is a growing recognition of the importance of individual happiness and compatibility in marriages, and attitudes towards divorce are gradually evolving, especially among younger generations."
