                "content": "Some of the biggest challenges seniors in Mexico face include inadequate healthcare access, low retirement benefits, poverty, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford quality healthcare and face long waiting times for services. Additionally, retirement benefits are often insufficient, making it difficult for them to cover basic needs. Poverty among seniors is a pressing issue, especially for those who do not have access to formal employment or social security. Social isolation is another challenge as seniors may lack social connections and activities, leading to loneliness and depression. Lastly, seniors sometimes face discrimination in the job market or when seeking social support, affecting their overall well-being and quality of life."
