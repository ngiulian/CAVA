                "content": "It is important to note that individual opinions on abortion can vary among women in Fiji. However, it has been reported that the majority of women in Fiji hold conservative views on abortion. Many women believe that abortion is morally wrong and should be illegal, considering it as taking a life. These views are often influenced by cultural and religious beliefs that prioritize the sanctity of life. Additionally, societal stigma surrounding abortion may contribute to the negative perceptions held by many women in Fiji. However, as there is diversity among individuals, it is essential to recognize that some women may have different opinions based on personal circumstances and experiences."
