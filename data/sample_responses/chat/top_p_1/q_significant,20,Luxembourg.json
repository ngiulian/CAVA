He succeeded his father, Grand Duke Jean, and became the sixth monarch of Luxembourg. This event marked a peaceful transition of power and continued the long-standing reign of the House of Nassau-Weilburg, which has ruled Luxembourg since 1890. Grand Duke Henri has since played a crucial role in representing Luxembourg internationally and has been instrumental in strengthening the country's position within the European Union."
