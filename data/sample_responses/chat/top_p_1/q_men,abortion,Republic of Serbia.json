However, in Serbia, like in many countries, discussions around abortion can involve a range of perspectives influenced by factors such as personal beliefs, religious convictions, socio-cultural norms, and political ideologies. Some men may hold differing opinions, including supporting a woman's right to choose, advocating for legal and safe access to abortion, or emphasizing the importance of preserving the rights and wellbeing of the unborn. Others may hold more conservative views, emphasizing the protection of unborn life, promoting alternative options like adoption, or highlighting the value of religious or moral principles. It is important to note that opinions on abortion can be complex, nuanced, and influenced by personal experiences and backgrounds."
