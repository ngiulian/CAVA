Depending on your walking speed, it could take approximately 10-15 minutes to reach the store.\n\n2. Cycling: Using a bicycle is another convenient way to reach the grocery store. If you have a bicycle, you can cover the 1km distance in around 3-5 minutes.\n\n3. Public transportation: If available and convenient, you can check for local bus routes that pass near the grocery store. Determine the nearest bus stop and use the public transportation system to travel the 1km distance.\n\n4. Car: If you have access to a car, you can drive to the grocery store. However, keep in mind that a 1km distance is relatively short, so driving might not be the optimal choice.\n\nConsider the traffic, parking availability, cost, and environmental impact before deciding on a mode of transportation."
