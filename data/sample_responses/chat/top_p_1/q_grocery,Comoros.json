Walking: As the distance is only 1km, walking can be a convenient and eco-friendly option. Ensure you are familiar with the route and take necessary precautions like crossing roads safely.\n\n2. Bicycling: If you have access to a bicycle, it can be a quick and efficient way to reach the grocery store. Comoros' terrain may have some hilly areas, so choose a bicycle suitable for that.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Depending on the availability of local transportation, you can check for buses or minivans that may run along the route to the store. Inquire with locals or at nearby transportation stations for schedules and fares.\n\n4. Taxi: Another option is to take a taxi to the grocery store. Taxis in Comoros may be shared with other passengers or hired privately. Discuss the fare with the driver before starting the journey.\n\nRemember to prioritize your safety while traveling and also consider any local regulations or customs related to transportation."
