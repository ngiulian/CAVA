However, one event that had a significant impact on Sweden and the world was the Stockholm terrorist attack on April 7, 2017. A hijacked truck was deliberately driven into pedestrians on a busy shopping street, resulting in five deaths and injuring several others. This event was regarded as a shocking act of terrorism and had a profound effect on Swedish society."
