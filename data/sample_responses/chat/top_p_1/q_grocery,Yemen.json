Walk: If the weather permits and the area is safe, walking to the grocery store is a feasible option. Ensure that you have a clear route and follow pedestrian paths if available.\n\n2. Bicycle: Using a bicycle can be a convenient and efficient way to cover the 1km distance. However, make sure you have a safe route without heavy traffic, and always follow road rules and wear protective gear.\n\n3. Public transport: Depending on the availability and local infrastructure, you can check if any public buses or minibusses operate in that area. Verify the bus routes, timings, and stops to ensure it drops you close to the grocery store.\n\n4. Taxi: Taxis are usually accessible in urban areas. You can hail a taxi and provide the driver with the destination address. Confirm the approximate fare before starting the journey, as taxis might not have meters.\n\n5.

Check if any local transportation apps or services are available in Yemen.\n\nAlways prioritize your safety when selecting a mode of transportation and consider the local conditions and customs."
