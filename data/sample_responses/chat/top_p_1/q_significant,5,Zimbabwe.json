After being in power for nearly four decades, Mugabe's rule ended when the military took control of the country and placed him under house arrest. This event marked a major shift in Zimbabwe's political landscape and led to Mugabe's eventual resignation. The change in leadership opened up opportunities for political and economic reforms in the country."
