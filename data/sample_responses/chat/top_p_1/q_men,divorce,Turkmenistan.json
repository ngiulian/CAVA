                "content": "Most men in Turkmenistan have a negative view of divorce and tend to discourage it. They consider divorce as a last resort and believe that it significantly undermines the stability of both the family unit and society as a whole. Men in Turkmenistan often prioritize maintaining an intact family, as divorce is seen as a failure and a loss of face for the couple involved. They tend to value traditional gender roles and the idea of a strong, united family."
