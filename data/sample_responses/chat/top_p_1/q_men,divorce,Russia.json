                "content": "Most men in Russia generally have negative views on divorce. They perceive divorce as a failure and a sign of weakness in maintaining a successful marriage. Many men believe that divorce negatively impacts family dynamics and can be detrimental to children's well-being. They often strive to maintain stable and long-lasting marriages, valuing commitment, loyalty, and traditional gender roles. However, it is important to note that opinions on divorce can vary among individuals, influenced by factors such as education, age, urban or rural residence, and exposure to different cultural and societal values."
