Many seniors struggle with various health issues but face difficulties in obtaining proper healthcare due to lack of accessibility and affordability. Additionally, pension benefits are often insufficient to meet their basic needs, leaving them vulnerable to poverty and an inadequate standard of living. Seniors also frequently experience social isolation due to limited social activities and lack of support systems, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional wellbeing."
