                "content": "Most men in Peru tend to have a negative view of divorce. They see it as a reflection of personal and social failure, and believe that it can cause harm to the family unit, especially for children. These men may consider divorce as a last resort, preferring to work through relationship issues or endure an unhappy marriage. Divorce is often stigmatized, leading many men to prioritize maintaining the marital bond despite difficulties."
