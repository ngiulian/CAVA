                "content": "The most significant event that happened in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe in the past 20 years was the discovery of offshore oil reserves in the Joint Development Zone (JDZ) between S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Nigeria. In 2001, an exploratory well drilled by a consortium led by American-based ExxonMobil confirmed the presence of significant oil reserves in the region. This discovery opened up the possibility of substantial revenue for the small island nation, which has been historically economically dependent on agriculture. The development of the oil sector has since been a major focus for the country, with various oil companies pursuing exploration and production activities in the JDZ. This event has the potential to significantly transform the economy of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, although the full extent of its impact is still being realized."
