                "content": "Teenagers in Bosnia and Herzegovina face several challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the high unemployment rate, which limits their opportunities for finding meaningful employment in the future. Many teenagers struggle to access quality education and career guidance, hindering their ability to make informed decisions about their future. Another challenge is the prevalence of substance abuse and addiction among youth, which adversely affects their physical and mental health. Limited access to affordable healthcare and mental health services is also a significant challenge for teenagers in the country. Additionally, there is a lack of youth engagement and participation in decision-making processes, leading to feelings of disempowerment and frustration. Finally, social and cultural norms, including gender-based discrimination, also pose challenges for Bosnian teenagers, especially in terms of gender equality and equal opportunities."
