The coup led to the removal of the elected government, resulting in political instability and international condemnation. This event had far-reaching consequences for Fiji, including the suspension from the Commonwealth, imposition of sanctions by various countries, and the subsequent rewriting of Fiji's constitution. It also had a lasting impact on Fiji's political landscape and its relations with the international community."
