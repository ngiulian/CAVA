                "content": "Teenagers in Ecuador face several significant challenges. One major challenge is limited access to quality education, especially in rural areas, which affects their opportunities for future employment and socioeconomic mobility. Economic inequality is another pressing issue, as many teenagers and their families struggle with poverty, leading to inadequate access to basic necessities and healthcare. Additionally, high rates of teenage pregnancy and early marriage pose obstacles to their personal development and access to opportunities. Substance abuse and gang violence also affect some teens, particularly in urban areas, threatening their safety and overall well-being."
