They believe that divorce is a personal choice that should be respected and that adults have the right to pursue happiness, even if it means ending a marriage. Men in Cuba are gradually adapting to the changing societal dynamics regarding divorce, acknowledging that relationships and personal fulfillment should be prioritized over societal pressures to stay in unhappy marriages."
