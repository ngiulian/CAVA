The volcano, located on the island of Fogo, erupted after 19 years of inactivity. This event had a profound impact on the local population, as it resulted in the complete destruction of two villages, Cha das Caldeiras and Portela. Several houses, farms, and infrastructure were also damaged or destroyed. The eruption forced the evacuation of thousands of people, and it took several months to bring the situation under control. This event had a significant economic, social, and environmental impact on the affected communities and the country as a whole."
