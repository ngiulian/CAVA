Hurricane Maria was a Category 5 hurricane and caused widespread devastation across Dominica. The entire island suffered extensive damage, including destruction of buildings, schools, infrastructure, and agricultural lands. The hurricane resulted in the loss of 31 lives and caused an estimated $1.37 billion in damages.\n\nThe impact of Hurricane Maria was felt across all sectors of the country, including tourism, agriculture, and energy. The government of Dominica declared a state of emergency and requested international assistance. The recovery and rebuilding efforts have been ongoing since then, with the government focusing on resilient reconstruction and sustainable development.\n\nThis event had a profound impact on Dominica and its people, highlighting the vulnerability of small island nations to the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters caused by climate change."
