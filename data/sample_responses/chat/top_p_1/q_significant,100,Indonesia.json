This marked the end of colonial rule by the Dutch and the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia. The proclamation paved the way for the nation's struggle for independence and laid the foundation for the formation of a unified Indonesian state. This event is still celebrated as Indonesia's Independence Day and represents a crucial turning point in the country's history."
