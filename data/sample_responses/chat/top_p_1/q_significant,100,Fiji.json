On May 14 of that year, Commodore Voreqe Bainimarama led a group of soldiers to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Dr. Timoci Bavadra. This coup marked the beginning of political instability in Fiji and a series of subsequent coups in 2000 and 2006. The events in 1987 had long-lasting effects on the country's political landscape, leading to changes in the constitution, racial tensions, and the erosion of democratic principles."
