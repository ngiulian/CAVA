However, traditionally, divorce is generally frowned upon in East Timor's society, including among men. Marriage is highly valued and seen as a lifelong commitment. Many men hold the belief that divorce is not a desirable or acceptable option, and they may prioritize maintaining the sanctity of the marital bond. Commitment to family, cultural values, and religious beliefs often play a significant role in shaping these opinions."
