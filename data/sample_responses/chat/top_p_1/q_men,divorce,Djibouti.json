Many men see divorce as a source of shame and a reflection of personal, societal, or religious disapproval. They often perceive divorce as a disruption to family unity and stability, which is highly valued in their culture. Additionally, traditional gender roles and patriarchal norms in Djibouti society can contribute to an unfavorable attitude towards divorce among men."
