However, it can be noted that Swaziland, a conservative country with strong cultural and religious influences, generally holds traditional values regarding reproductive matters. In such a context, many men in Swaziland may express negative opinions towards abortion due to religious beliefs, cultural norms, and societal expectations. However, it is important to remember that viewpoints can differ significantly among individuals based on personal experiences, education, and exposure to different perspectives."
