However, there are some common perceptions that can be found among most women in Benin regarding divorce.\n\nFirstly, divorce is generally perceived as a last resort for women facing severe marital challenges. Women in Benin tend to prioritize the stability and sanctity of marriage and hold a strong belief in the values of commitment and family unity. Consequently, divorce is often seen as a socially undesirable outcome and is generally frowned upon. Women may feel societal pressure to preserve their marriage and endure difficulties rather than seeking a divorce.\n\nFurthermore, divorce is often viewed as a potential source of shame and stigmatization for women. Separation from their spouse may lead to negative judgments from their family, friends, and the community, causing them to be excluded or marginalized. This societal perception can discourage women from pursuing divorce, even in situations where it may be necessary for their well-being or safety.\n\nAdditionally, economic factors can play a significant role in shaping women's perceptions of divorce. In many cases, women in Benin rely on their husbands for financial support and stability. Divorce can disrupt their socio-economic standing, potentially leaving them financially vulnerable and struggling to provide for themselves and their children. This financial insecurity often acts as a deterrent for women seeking divorce.\n\nHowever, it is important to highlight that attitudes towards divorce are gradually evolving in Benin. With"
