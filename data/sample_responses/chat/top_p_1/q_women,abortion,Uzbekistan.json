The majority of women in Uzbekistan are influenced by cultural and religious beliefs that value the sanctity of life and the importance of family. They consider abortion as a sin and believe it goes against their traditional values. Consequently, most women in Uzbekistan would opt to continue their pregnancies rather than seek an abortion, even in difficult circumstances."
