                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Iran in the past 20 years is the 2015 nuclear agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). This landmark agreement was signed between Iran and the P5+1 group of world powers (United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China) along with the European Union. It aimed to limit Iran's nuclear program and ensure it remained peaceful in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nThe JCPOA was seen as a diplomatic breakthrough and a major achievement in international relations. It helped alleviate tensions between Iran and the international community, especially regarding concerns over Iran's nuclear capabilities. The agreement placed rigorous restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities, increased monitoring and verification measures, and allowed for international inspections. In return, economic sanctions against Iran were gradually lifted, opening up possibilities for foreign investment and trade.\n\nHowever, in 2018, the United States unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA, re-imposing sanctions on Iran. This decision strained relations between Iran and the United States, leading to a period of increased tensions, regional conflicts, and subsequent violations of the JCPOA by Iran. The future of the agreement remains uncertain, but its initial signing and impact on international relations have undoubtedly made it one of the most significant events in Iran in the past two decades."
