However, based on social and cultural factors prevalent in Jordan, it can be understood that many men hold conservative views on abortion.\n\nIn Jordan, a predominantly Muslim country, the prevailing cultural and religious beliefs emphasize the sanctity of life, and there is a general cultural inclination towards traditional family values. As a result, many men in Jordan may typically hold conservative views regarding abortion.\n\nThe majority of men in Jordan may perceive abortion as morally wrong and against religious teachings, often considering it a violation of the sanctity of life. They may value the protection and preservation of unborn children, believing that life begins at conception.\n\nAdditionally, societal and familial expectations in Jordan often prioritize the importance of marriage, family, and procreation. Consequently, men may view abortion as a challenge to these traditional values since it disrupts the expected path towards building a family.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that there may be some diverse views among men in Jordan, especially in more liberal and urban areas, where attitudes towards abortion may be more progressive and aligned with individual autonomy and women's reproductive rights."
