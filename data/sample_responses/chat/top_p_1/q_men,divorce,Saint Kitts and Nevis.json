Some men may traditionally hold conservative views and perceive divorce as undesirable or against societal norms. They might prioritize preserving the sanctity of marriage or maintaining family unity. However, there are also men who have more progressive perspectives and believe that divorce can be a valid solution to irreconcilable differences or unhappy marriages. Overall, the attitudes towards divorce among men in Saint Kitts and Nevis are likely a blend of traditional and modern beliefs, shaped by cultural, religious, and personal values."
