                "content": "One of the biggest challenges seniors in Nepal face is lack of access to healthcare. Many seniors in rural areas struggle to access medical facilities and afford necessary treatments due to high healthcare costs.\n\nAnother challenge is economic insecurity. Due to limited job opportunities and inadequate social security systems, many seniors in Nepal face financial difficulties. They often rely on their children for support, but this dependency is not always guaranteed, leaving them vulnerable to poverty and homelessness.\n\nSocial isolation is also a significant challenge for seniors in Nepal. With changing cultural values and the migration of younger generations, seniors often experience loneliness and disconnection. They may lack social support and struggle to maintain relationships, leading to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.\n\nLastly, age discrimination and neglect pose challenges to seniors' well-being. They may face discrimination in employment, healthcare, and social interactions. Furthermore, neglect and abuse of seniors, particularly widows, can be prevalent in some parts of the country, leaving them vulnerable and unprotected."
