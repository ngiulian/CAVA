Varosha, which had been abandoned since 1974 following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, was partially reopened by Turkish Cypriot authorities. This move caused tensions and international criticism, as Varosha is located in the UN buffer zone and its reopening was seen as a violation of UN resolutions and a setback to peace negotiations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots."
