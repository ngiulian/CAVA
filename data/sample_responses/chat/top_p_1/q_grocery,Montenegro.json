Walking: Since the distance is relatively short, you can consider walking to the grocery store. Ensure you have comfortable walking shoes, follow pedestrian paths or sidewalks, and be cautious of traffic.\n\n2. Bicycling: If you have access to a bicycle, it can be a faster and convenient way to reach the store. Montenegro often has dedicated bike lanes or quiet roads suitable for cycling.\n\n3. Public transportation: Check if there are any local buses or shuttles that could take you to the grocery store. Montenegro usually has a well-connected public transportation system, so you may find a bus stop close to your location.\n\n4. Taxi or ridesharing service: Utilize a taxi service or popular ridesharing apps, such as Uber or Bolt, to reach the grocery store quickly and comfortably. This option offers convenience, especially if you have heavy groceries to carry back.\n\nRemember to consider the availability, cost, and convenience of each mode of transportation, and choose the method that suits your needs best."
