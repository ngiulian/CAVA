However, it can be stated that Romania is a predominantly conservative and religious country, where many individuals, including some men, hold traditional values that prioritize the preservation of life and oppose abortion. As a result, there is a significant portion of the male population that may view abortion as morally wrong, believing in protecting the rights of the unborn child. However, there are also men who support women's reproductive rights and believe in a woman's autonomy to make decisions regarding her body. Public opinion on abortion is a complex matter, and diverse views exist among men in Romania."
