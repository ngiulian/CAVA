                "content": "According to cultural and societal norms prevailing in Ethiopia, the majority of men typically hold negative views towards divorce. Divorce is generally perceived as socially unacceptable and against traditional values, particularly in rural areas. Men often hold a patriarchal mindset and prioritize the stability of the family unit. They consider divorce as a sign of failure, and it is generally stigmatized for both men and women involved. However, there may be variations in opinions based on individual education, exposure to diverse perspectives, and urbanization. These factors can influence attitudes towards divorce, making them relatively more accepting among younger generations and in urban settings."
