                "content": "Seniors in Cape Verde face various challenges, including healthcare access and affordability, limited social support networks, poverty and financial insecurity, and inadequate infrastructure for elderly care. Access to quality healthcare and affordable medical services can be limited, particularly in rural areas, making it difficult for seniors to meet their healthcare needs. Moreover, the absence of a comprehensive social support system places additional burdens on seniors, leaving them vulnerable to isolation and loneliness. Many seniors in Cape Verde also struggle with poverty and insufficient pensions, which affects their overall well-being and ability to meet basic needs. Additionally, the country lacks proper infrastructure and specialized facilities for elderly care, resulting in a lack of adequate long-term care options for seniors."
