The referendum enabled Belizeans to vote on whether or not to take the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for a final resolution. The participation rate was high, and the majority (55.4%) voted in favor of settling the matter at the ICJ. This event marked a crucial step in the long-standing territorial dispute between Belize and Guatemala and demonstrated the democratic process and people's determination to seek a resolution."
