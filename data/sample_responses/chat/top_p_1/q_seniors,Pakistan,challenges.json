There is also a lack of pension and social security benefits for many seniors, resulting in financial hardships. Social isolation and neglect by families are prevalent issues, leaving seniors vulnerable to emotional and physical abuse. Additionally, limited opportunities for employment, age discrimination, and inadequate safety measures pose challenges for seniors' overall well-being."
