                "content": "It is important to note that opinions on abortion can vary among individuals, and it is challenging to summarize the perspective of an entire group. However, there is a wide range of viewpoints among women in Iran regarding abortion. \n\nIran maintains an overall conservative approach to abortion, where it is generally illegal unless it threatens the life of the pregnant woman. However, exceptions can be made in cases of fetal abnormalities or severe health risks. The Islamic government in Iran promotes the importance of preserving life and encourages having children as a social and religious duty.\n\nWhile some women in Iran may align with the conservative stance on abortion, others may advocate for more lenient laws, considering factors such as women's rights, financial stability, and health issues. Some women might perceive restrictive abortion laws as infringing upon their reproductive rights and personal freedom.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that individual beliefs on abortion can be influenced by various factors, including religious, cultural, and personal values. As a result, the opinions of most women in Iran regarding abortion can differ significantly."
