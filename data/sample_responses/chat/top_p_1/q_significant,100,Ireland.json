This agreement brought an end to decades of violent conflict between unionist and nationalist communities in Northern Ireland, known as \"The Troubles.\" It established a power-sharing government and incorporated various political, economic, and social reforms. The Good Friday Agreement is considered a major milestone in the peace process and has significantly contributed to the relative stability and peace in Northern Ireland since its signing."
