                "content": "Most men in Oman have mixed opinions about divorce. Some view it as a last resort and believe that it should only be considered when all efforts to reconcile the marriage have failed. They see divorce as a negative and unfortunate outcome that can disrupt social harmony and cause financial and emotional difficulties for both parties involved. Therefore, they typically discourage divorce and advocate for efforts to salvage the marriage.\n\nHowever, there are also men who recognize that divorce can be a necessary step in certain situations, such as in cases of abuse, infidelity, or irreconcilable differences. They believe that if a marriage becomes toxic or untenable, divorce provides an opportunity for individuals to seek happiness and emotional well-being. These individuals prioritize personal happiness and freedom over societal expectations or norms.\n\nOverall, while there may be a prevailing cultural expectation for marriages to be maintained despite challenges, the views on divorce among men in Oman will vary depending on their personal beliefs, experiences, and cultural backgrounds."
