However, according to various surveys and studies, the general consensus among men in Estonia is that abortion should be a woman's decision, as it primarily affects her bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom. Many men believe that women should have the right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy or undergo an abortion, and that it is not their place to interfere with such personal choices. Some men advocate for comprehensive sexual education and accessible contraception to reduce the need for abortions altogether. Overall, the majority of men in Estonia respect a woman's right to make decisions regarding her own reproductive health."
