This event marked a major turning point in Turkey's political landscape and had lasting consequences for the country. The coup attempt, orchestrated by a faction within the Turkish military, aimed to overthrow the government led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. However, Erdogan's supporters took to the streets, and with the help of loyal military forces, were able to repel the coup attempt. The event resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives and led to a widespread crackdown on perceived enemies of the state, including purges within the military, judiciary, academia, and media. The failed coup attempt also heightened political polarization within the country and had significant implications for Turkey's domestic and foreign policies."
