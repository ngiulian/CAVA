                "content": "Most women in Kashmir have mixed opinions about divorce. While some view divorce as a necessary solution to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others consider it a last resort due to societal pressure and the stigma surrounding divorce in the region. Many women believe that divorce should be an option in cases of domestic violence, infidelity, or incompatibility. However, the fear of losing social status, financial insecurity, potential custody battles, and the difficulty of remarrying can lead to hesitation among women when considering divorce. Overall, the views on divorce among women in Kashmir vary depending on personal circumstances and cultural norms."
