After the fall of President Siad Barre's regime, Somalia descended into chaos, with various factions, warlords, and clans vying for power and control. This led to a prolonged and devastating civil war that resulted in widespread violence, displacement, famine, and the breakdown of law and order throughout the country. The consequences of this event continue to impact Somalia's political, economic, and social landscape to this day."
