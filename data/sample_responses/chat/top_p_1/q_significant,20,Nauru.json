The RPC was established in 2001 as part of Australia's policies on offshore processing of asylum seekers arriving by boat. It was located on Nauru and housed individuals seeking asylum while their refugee status was being assessed.\n\nThe closure of the RPC had a significant impact on Nauru socially, economically, and politically. The center had been a major source of income for the nation, contributing to its GDP, and providing employment opportunities. The decision to close the RPC forced Nauru to find alternative sources of revenue and economic development initiatives.\n\nAdditionally, the closure led to the resettlement of many asylum seekers who had been held on Nauru. This had implications for social and cultural aspects of Nauruan society as well. The long-term presence of the center had raised issues regarding mental health, human rights, and the treatment of asylum seekers.\n\nOverall, the closure of the Regional Processing Centre marked a significant turning point for Nauru in the past 20 years, impacting its economy, society, and international relations."
