Walking: If the weather is nice and you have enough time, walking could be a good option. It would take you approximately 10-15 minutes to cover the 1km distance.\n\n2. Public transportation: Mexico typically has a well-connected public transportation system, including buses and metro systems in major cities. You can check for the nearest bus stop or metro station, and take a bus or train to your destination.\n\n3. Taxis: Taxis are readily available in many parts of Mexico. You can hail a taxi from the street or use a ride-hailing app to book a cab. Make sure to confirm the fare and ensure the taxi is safe and registered.\n\n4. Bike: If you have a bicycle or can rent one, cycling to the grocery store could be a convenient and potentially faster option, depending on traffic conditions.\n\nConsider choosing the mode of transportation based on factors such as convenience, weather conditions, cost, and personal preference."
