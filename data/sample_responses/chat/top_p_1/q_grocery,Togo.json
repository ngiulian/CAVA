Walking: Since the distance is relatively short, walking can be a convenient and eco-friendly option. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and stay on the pedestrian paths if available.\n\n2. Cycling: If you own or have access to a bicycle, it can be a faster mode of transportation. Togo has several bicycle rental services as well.\n\n3. Public transport: Depending on the availability and local infrastructure, you can check if any public buses or minibusses operate along the route to the grocery store. This option may take some research or asking locals for information.\n\n4. Taxi or motorcycle taxi: Taxis and motorcycle taxis (known as zemidjans) are common in Togo. You can flag down a taxi or zemidjan to take you to the grocery store. Negotiate the fare before the ride.\n\nRemember to consider the local traffic conditions and safety precautions while choosing your method of transportation."
