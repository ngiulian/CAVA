This event marked a major milestone for the country as it transitioned from a post-communist state to becoming a member of the EU. Bulgaria's EU accession marked its commitment to democracy, open markets, and the rule of law, and provided new economic opportunities, increased foreign investments, and greater political integration with other European nations."
