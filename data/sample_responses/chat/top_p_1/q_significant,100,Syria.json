The conflict began as a pro-democracy uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime and quickly escalated into a full-scale war involving multiple domestic and international actors. This war has had far-reaching consequences, resulting in the displacement of millions of Syrians, the death of hundreds of thousands of people, and widespread destruction and devastation across the country. It has also given rise to extremist groups like ISIS, drawing in various regional and global powers who support different factions within Syria. The Syrian Civil War has had a profound impact on the geopolitical landscape of the region and has caused a major humanitarian crisis."
