                "content": "In Bhutan, the perception of divorce among men varies. While some men hold traditional views that consider divorce taboo and frowned upon, others are more supportive and open-minded about it. \n\nTraditional perspectives often perceive divorce as a family and societal failure, believing that it goes against the values of marriage and disrupts the harmony of the community. Men adhering to these beliefs might view divorce as a last resort, preferring to preserve the sanctity of marriage and try to resolve issues through compromise and reconciliation. This attitude is influenced by cultural and societal norms, emphasizing the importance of loyalty, commitment, and maintaining family unity.\n\nHowever, in recent years, attitudes towards divorce have started to shift as Bhutan experiences social and cultural changes. Modernization, education, exposure to global influences, and increased awareness of individual rights have contributed to a more progressive outlook. Some men now consider divorce as a viable option for resolving irreconcilable differences and escaping unhappy marriages. They prioritize personal happiness, fulfillment, and the pursuit of individual growth, recognizing that divorce might be the best outcome in certain circumstances.\n\nOverall, the views on divorce among men in Bhutan encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from those who firmly oppose it due to traditional values to those who are more open to its possibility considering personal well-being and happiness. The ongoing transformation of societal norms and increasing emphasis on individual rights continue to shape and diversify opinions on divorce among men in Bhutan."
