Additionally, many adults struggle to find stable employment and adequate housing. The cost of living is high, leading to financial hardships for many individuals. Furthermore, the lack of job opportunities and low wages contribute to difficulties in saving for retirement. Another significant challenge is the gender gap, with women often experiencing limited opportunities and facing discrimination in both the workplace and society."
