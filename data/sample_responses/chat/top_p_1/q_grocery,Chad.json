Ensure that you wear appropriate clothing, carry any necessary items, and stay hydrated, especially considering the climate in Chad.\n\n2. Bicycling: If you have access to a bicycle, it can be a convenient mode of transportation to cover the 1km distance. Make sure you have a functioning bicycle and wear a helmet if available.\n\n3. Public transportation: Check if there are any local public transportation options available, such as buses or minibusses called \"taxi-brousses.\" Inquire with locals or at a nearby transportation hub for details on schedules and fares.\n\n4. Private vehicle: If you own or have access to a private vehicle, you can drive to the grocery store.
