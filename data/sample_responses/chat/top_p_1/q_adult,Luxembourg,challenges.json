The country's expensive housing, healthcare, and education systems can be difficult for adults to afford and sustain. The job market is highly competitive, and finding suitable employment can be a challenge for both nationals and expatriates. Balancing work commitments with personal life can prove challenging due to long working hours and societal expectations. Additionally, the multicultural nature of Luxembourg can pose integration and language barriers for newcomers."
