Many seniors struggle to afford quality healthcare and face difficulties in accessing necessary medications and treatments. Social isolation is also a significant issue, as seniors may lack companionship and social connections, leading to loneliness and mental health concerns. Financial constraints are common, as a significant portion of seniors rely on limited pensions or have inadequate savings to cover their expenses. Additionally, age discrimination can be a challenge, particularly in terms of employment opportunities and societal attitudes towards aging."
