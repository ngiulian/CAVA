On August 6, 1962, Jamaica became an independent nation, ending over 300 years of British rule. This event marked a crucial moment in the country's history, granting Jamaica full political control over its affairs and paving the way for its development as a sovereign nation. Independence Day is celebrated annually in Jamaica to commemorate this milestone."
