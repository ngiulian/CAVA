                "content": "Seniors in Lesotho face several challenges, including high poverty levels, limited access to healthcare, lack of social protection, and inadequate transportation infrastructure. Many seniors struggle to meet their basic needs due to limited resources and financial support, leading to a high prevalence of poverty among this population. Additionally, accessing healthcare services is challenging, especially in rural areas where there is a shortage of medical facilities and professionals. There is also a lack of social protection programs such as pensions, leaving seniors vulnerable to economic insecurity. Lastly, inadequate transportation infrastructure makes it difficult for seniors, especially those with mobility issues, to access essential services and engage in social activities."
