                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Trinidad and Tobago face are related to financial insecurity, limited access to affordable healthcare, inadequate support services, and social isolation. Many seniors struggle to make ends meet due to the lack of sufficient pension benefits or savings, leading to financial instability. Additionally, healthcare costs can be burdensome, particularly for those with chronic illnesses, as access to affordable medical services and prescription medication is often a challenge. The availability and quality of support services for seniors, such as home care, assisted living facilities, and transportation services, are limited, making it difficult for them to receive the assistance they may need. Lastly, social isolation is a concern, as seniors may feel lonely and disconnected from their communities due to factors like the loss of spouses, limited mobility, or insufficient social engagement opportunities."
