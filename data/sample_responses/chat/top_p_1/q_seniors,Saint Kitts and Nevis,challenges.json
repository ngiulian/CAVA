These seniors often struggle to afford adequate healthcare services due to limited income and lack of health insurance coverage. Additionally, financial difficulties make it hard for them to meet their daily needs and access quality living conditions. Social isolation is another major challenge, as seniors may face loneliness, isolation, and limited interaction with their communities. Lastly, age-related health problems such as chronic diseases, mobility issues, and mental health concerns pose significant challenges for seniors in Saint Kitts and Nevis."
