This election was significant because it sparked controversy and led to political unrest in the country. Incumbent President Patrice Talon sought re-election for a second term amidst accusations of authoritarianism and suppression of opposition voices.\n\nThe election process faced criticism from opposition parties and civil society organizations who claimed that it was unfair and undemocratic. Several prominent opposition figures were disqualified from participating in the election, leading to allegations of a shrinking political space.\n\nAdditionally, the government imposed restrictions on internet access during the election period, further raising concerns about transparency and the freedom of expression. Despite these controversies, President Patrice Talon was re-elected with a reported 86% of the vote.\n\nThe 2021 presidential election highlighted the ongoing political tensions and challenges related to democracy and political freedom in Benin."
