                "content": "The seniors in Ivory Coast face various challenges. One of the biggest challenges is poverty and lack of financial security. Many seniors do not have access to adequate pension or social security benefits, leaving them struggling to meet their basic needs.\n\nHealthcare is another major challenge for seniors. Limited access to quality healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas, puts their health at risk. Many seniors suffer from chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, but they may not receive timely and appropriate medical attention.\n\nSocial isolation and neglect are also significant challenges faced by seniors in Ivory Coast. Due to changing social structures and modernization, traditional family support systems have weakened, leading to elders being left alone or neglected in some cases.\n\nAdditionally, illiteracy and lack of digital literacy can make it difficult for many seniors to access information, communicate, and participate in modern society. This further limits their opportunities for social engagement, employment, and overall well-being.\n\nOverall, improving the financial security, healthcare access, social inclusion, and literacy levels of seniors in Ivory Coast are crucial challenges that need attention to ensure their well-being and quality of life."
