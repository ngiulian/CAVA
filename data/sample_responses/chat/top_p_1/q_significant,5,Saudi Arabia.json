For decades, Saudi Arabia had upheld a policy that prohibited women from driving, making it the only country in the world to enforce such a ban. The decision to allow women to drive was seen as a major step towards modernization and promoting gender equality in the conservative kingdom. It was met with widespread acclaim both domestically and internationally, recognizing it as a transformative moment for Saudi women's rights."
