                "content": "Many men in Maldives have negative views on divorce. They often believe that divorce is a shameful and dishonorable act, as it goes against the cultural and religious values of the predominantly Muslim society. Men usually prefer to maintain a stable and intact family structure, valuing societal expectations and preserving their reputation within the community. Divorce is often seen as a last resort or an undesirable option, and men may feel pressure to avoid it, even in the face of relationship difficulties."
