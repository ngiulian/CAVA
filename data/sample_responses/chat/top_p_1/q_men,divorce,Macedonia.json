They believe that marriage is a sacred institution and should be upheld at all costs. They prioritize family unity and stability and may perceive divorce as a failure or a social taboo. However, it is essential to acknowledge that views on divorce can vary among individuals, and this summary represents a general perspective rather than the opinion of all men in Macedonia."
