The Antarctic Treaty is an international agreement that governs the continent and its surrounding waters. It was signed by 12 nations, including the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, Argentina, and Australia, among others. This treaty established Antarctica as a scientific preserve and prohibited military activity, mineral mining, and nuclear testing on the continent. Additionally, the treaty promotes cooperation among nations for scientific research and environmental protection in Antarctica. It has been recognized as a successful example of international cooperation and has been signed by many more countries since its initial signing."
