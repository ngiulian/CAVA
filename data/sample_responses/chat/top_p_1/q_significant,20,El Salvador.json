This conflict lasted for over 12 years and resulted in the loss of over 75,000 lives. The peace agreement signed in January 1992 helped bring an end to the violence and led to significant political and social changes in the country. The post-war period has seen efforts towards national reconciliation, the establishment of democratic institutions, and the growth of the economy."
