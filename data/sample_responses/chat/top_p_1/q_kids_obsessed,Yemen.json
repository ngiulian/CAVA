However, like many children around the world, Yemeni kids may be obsessed with various things such as technology, social media, video games, television shows, sports, fashion, music, and hobbies. Additionally, due to the challenging circumstances and ongoing conflict in Yemen, children may also be preoccupied with concerns about safety, education, and their future prospects."
