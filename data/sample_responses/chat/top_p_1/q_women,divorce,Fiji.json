                "content": "Most women in Fiji have mixed opinions about divorce. For some, divorce is seen as a decision that should only be taken as a last resort when all efforts to salvage the marriage have failed. They believe that marriage is a sacred bond and divorce goes against traditional values and family expectations. Many women prioritize maintaining their family's reputation and cultural norms over personal happiness.\n\nHowever, there is also a growing number of women in Fiji who view divorce as a viable option to escape abusive or unhappy marriages. These women recognize the importance of their own wellbeing and believe that divorce can empower them to seek better opportunities and create a healthier environment for themselves and their children.\n\nOverall, the attitudes towards divorce among women in Fiji are slowly evolving, with traditional values still influencing many women's perspectives, while a shifting mindset reflects the changing social dynamics and the push for gender equality."
