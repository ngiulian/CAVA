In response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States, along with NATO allies, launched Operation Enduring Freedom to overthrow the Taliban regime and dismantle Al-Qaeda, who had been harbored by the Taliban in Afghanistan. This invasion marked the beginning of a protracted conflict and occupation that lasted for two decades."
