After a disputed presidential election, there were widespread protests and political instability throughout the country. This crisis led to a series of negotiations between political factions and eventually resulted in a transitional period, followed by a peaceful transfer of power to President Andry Rajoelina. The political crisis had significant implications for the country's governance, economy, and social stability."
