                "content": "Seniors in Marshall Islands face several significant challenges. Firstly, there is a limited availability of healthcare services in remote areas, making it difficult for seniors to access medical care. Additionally, chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension are prevalent among the elderly population, exacerbating the need for proper healthcare facilities and specialized treatments. Secondly, there is a lack of financial resources and social security programs to support the elderly. Many seniors face poverty and struggle to meet their basic needs. Thirdly, the lack of suitable housing options and infrastructure poses challenges for older adults' mobility and independent living. This, along with the absence of elderly care facilities, adds to the burden on seniors and their families. Lastly, limited opportunities for social engagement and participation can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness among seniors. These challenges collectively affect the overall well-being and quality of life for seniors in Marshall Islands."
