                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Norway face include social isolation, healthcare access and affordability, financial security, and age discrimination. Many seniors, especially those living alone, experience loneliness and lack of social interaction, which can lead to mental health issues. Access to quality healthcare can be a concern, particularly in remote areas, and the rising costs of healthcare and medication can be burdensome for seniors. Financial security is an issue for those who rely on pensions and savings, as they may struggle to cover their expenses adequately. Lastly, age discrimination in various aspects of life, including employment and public services, can hinder seniors from fully participating in society."
