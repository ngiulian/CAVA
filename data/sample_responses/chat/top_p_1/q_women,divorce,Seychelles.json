However, it can be inferred that attitudes towards divorce among women in Seychelles may vary based on various factors such as education, socioeconomic status, religion, and personal experiences. \n\nWhile there is no comprehensive study on this topic, it is known that Seychelles, being a mixed society influenced by African, European, and Asian cultures, generally holds conservative values when it comes to marriage and family. Divorce is often seen as a last resort or less socially acceptable due to the emphasis placed on maintaining stable and lasting relationships.\n\nThat said, societal attitudes towards divorce have been evolving globally, including in Seychelles. There is an increasing acknowledgment that divorce can be a necessary solution in cases of abusive or dysfunctional relationships. Modern women in Seychelles might have a greater inclination towards embracing individual empowerment and independence, leading to more openness towards divorce as an option to escape unhappy marriages.\n\nOverall, it is important to consider that perceptions and opinions on divorce are subjective and can differ significantly among individuals based on personal beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and personal experiences."
