Limited access to healthcare: Many seniors in Burkina Faso have limited access to proper healthcare facilities, especially in rural areas. They often lack the necessary medical services, including regular check-ups, medications, and specialized care, leading to untreated chronic conditions and a decline in their overall well-being.\n\n2. Poverty and financial insecurity: Seniors in Burkina Faso are often financially dependent on their families or rely on meager pensions. Limited job opportunities, lack of savings, and reduced income in older age contribute to financial insecurity and poverty among seniors, making it challenging for them to meet their basic needs and access essential services.\n\n3. Illiteracy and lack of educational opportunities: Many seniors in Burkina Faso face illiteracy and have limited educational opportunities. This affects their ability to access information, engage in productive activities, and participate in decision-making processes, further exacerbating their vulnerability and limiting their active involvement in society.\n\n4. Social exclusion and isolation: Seniors in Burkina Faso often experience social exclusion and isolation due to various factors such as rural-urban migration, breakdown of traditional family structures, and increasing urbanization. This diminishes their social connections and participation in community activities, leading to feelings of loneliness and a lack of emotional support.\n\n5. Inadequate"
