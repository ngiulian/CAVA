The disaster, known as the Palu-Koro Earthquake, was a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that triggered a tsunami resulting in widespread devastation. The combined impact of the earthquake and tsunami caused the loss of more than 4,300 lives, with thousands of people injured or missing. The disaster also led to significant infrastructure damage, including the destruction of homes, buildings, and roads. This event not only had a devastating humanitarian impact but also highlighted the need for improved disaster preparedness and response capabilities in the country."
