Men in Benin tend to prioritize traditional family values and believe in maintaining a lasting marriage. They may view divorce as a failure, breaking societal norms, and bringing shame upon families involved. However, it is important to note that individual perspectives on divorce can vary and these views may not be applicable to every man in Benin."
