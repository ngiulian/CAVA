                "content": "Teenagers in Croatia face several challenges, including high unemployment rates, limited educational opportunities, substance abuse, mental health issues, and social pressures. The country's economic situation has resulted in a lack of job prospects for young people, making it difficult for them to secure stable employment. Additionally, the education system may not adequately prepare them for the job market, leading to a mismatch between skills and available positions. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drug use, is a concern among teenagers, with peer pressure and easy access contributing to the problem. Mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, are also prevalent, often exacerbated by academic stress and societal expectations. Lastly, teenagers in Croatia may face social pressures related to appearance, popularity, and fitting in, which can impact their self-esteem and overall well-being."
