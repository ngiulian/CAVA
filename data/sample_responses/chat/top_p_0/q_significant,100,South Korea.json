                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in South Korea in the past 100 years is the division of the Korean Peninsula and the subsequent Korean War. \n\nThe division occurred in 1945 after World War II, when the Korean Peninsula was split into two separate countries: North Korea, supported by the Soviet Union, and South Korea, supported by the United States. This division led to tensions between the two countries, eventually escalating into the Korean War in 1950.\n\nThe Korean War lasted for three years and resulted in significant loss of life and destruction. It had a profound impact on the Korean people, as well as the geopolitical landscape of the region. The war ended in 1953 with an armistice agreement, but no formal peace treaty has been signed, leaving the two countries technically still at war.\n\nThe division and the Korean War have had long-lasting effects on South Korea, shaping its political, social, and economic development. It also led to the establishment of a heavily fortified border between the two countries, known as the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which remains a symbol of the ongoing division."
