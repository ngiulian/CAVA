                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Uruguay face include financial insecurity, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions and low incomes, making it difficult to cover their basic needs and afford healthcare expenses. Additionally, the healthcare system may not adequately address the specific needs of older adults, leading to limited access to quality medical services. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. Lastly, age discrimination can hinder seniors' participation in the workforce and society, limiting their opportunities for personal growth and financial stability."
