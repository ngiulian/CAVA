They generally believe that divorce is a shameful and unacceptable act that goes against their cultural and religious values. Men in Vanuatu prioritize the stability and unity of the family, and divorce is seen as a disruption to this ideal. They often perceive divorce as a failure and a sign of weakness, and they may stigmatize individuals who go through a divorce."
