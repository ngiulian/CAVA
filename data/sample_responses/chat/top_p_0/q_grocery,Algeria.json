Simply follow the route to the grocery store, which may involve using sidewalks or pedestrian paths.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle, cycling can be a faster and more efficient way to reach the grocery store. Algeria has some cycling lanes in certain areas, so make sure to use them if available.\n\n3. Public transportation: Depending on the location and availability, you can use public transportation such as buses or trams to reach the grocery store.
