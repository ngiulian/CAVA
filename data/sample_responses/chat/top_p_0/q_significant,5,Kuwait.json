Sheikh Sabah had been the ruler of Kuwait since 2006 and played a crucial role in shaping the country's foreign policy and regional diplomacy. His passing marked the end of an era and triggered a period of mourning in Kuwait. Additionally, it led to the succession of his half-brother, Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, as the new Emir of Kuwait."
