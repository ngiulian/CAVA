                "content": "Teenagers in Grenada face several challenges, including limited educational opportunities, high rates of unemployment, substance abuse, limited access to healthcare, and limited recreational activities. The education system in Grenada is often criticized for its lack of resources and outdated curriculum, making it difficult for teenagers to receive a quality education. Additionally, the high rates of unemployment in the country make it challenging for teenagers to find job opportunities and gain financial independence. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and marijuana, is also a prevalent issue among teenagers in Grenada. Limited access to healthcare services, especially in rural areas, poses a challenge for teenagers seeking medical assistance. Lastly, the lack of recreational activities and safe spaces for teenagers to engage in positive social interactions and hobbies is another challenge they face."
