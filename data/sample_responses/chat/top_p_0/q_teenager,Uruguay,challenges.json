                "content": "Teenagers in Uruguay face several challenges, including educational issues, substance abuse, mental health concerns, and limited job opportunities. The education system often struggles to provide quality education, leading to a lack of motivation and limited future prospects for many teenagers. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and marijuana, is prevalent among teenagers, leading to health problems and potential addiction. Mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, are also common, with limited access to mental health services exacerbating the problem. Additionally, the job market in Uruguay is competitive, making it difficult for teenagers to find employment and gain financial independence."
