                "content": "Most men in Cyprus have a negative perception of divorce. They often view it as a failure and a source of shame, believing that it reflects poorly on their masculinity and ability to maintain a stable family. Divorce is generally seen as a last resort, with men preferring to preserve their marriages even in unhappy or dysfunctional situations. Additionally, there is a societal expectation for men to be the primary breadwinners and protectors of their families, which further contributes to their reluctance towards divorce."
