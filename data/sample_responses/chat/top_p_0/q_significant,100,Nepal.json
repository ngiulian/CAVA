This event took place on May 28, 2008, marking the end of the 240-year-old Shah dynasty and the beginning of a new era for Nepal. The decision to abolish the monarchy came after a decade-long Maoist insurgency and a series of political movements demanding democratic reforms. The event brought significant political and social changes to Nepal, including the drafting of a new constitution and the election of a constituent assembly."
