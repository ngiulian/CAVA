However, there are some common perspectives that can be observed among many women in Iraq regarding divorce.\n\nIn Iraq, divorce is generally considered a socially stigmatized and challenging decision for women. Many women view divorce as a last resort due to the societal pressure to maintain a stable and intact family unit. Divorce is often seen as a failure and can lead to judgment and criticism from family, friends, and the wider community.\n\nHowever, there are instances where women in Iraq may support divorce, particularly in cases of abuse, infidelity, or irreconcilable differences. Women who have experienced domestic violence or oppressive marriages may view divorce as a means to escape an unhealthy or dangerous situation and regain their autonomy.\n\nAdditionally, some women in Iraq may perceive divorce as a way to pursue personal growth, education, or career opportunities that were previously restricted within the confines of marriage. Divorce can provide them with a chance to assert their independence and make choices that align with their own aspirations and desires.\n\nOverall, while divorce is generally viewed negatively by society, women in Iraq may have diverse opinions on the matter, influenced by their personal circumstances, cultural norms, and the level of support they receive from their families and communities."
