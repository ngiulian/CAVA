This marked a major milestone for the country, as it became the 28th member state of the EU. Croatia's EU membership has had significant implications for its economy, politics, and society, including increased trade opportunities, access to EU funds, and the ability to participate in decision-making processes within the EU. It also symbolized Croatia's integration into the broader European community and its commitment to European values and principles."
