The PNMS is a groundbreaking conservation initiative that designates 80% of Palau's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as a fully protected marine reserve, making it one of the largest marine protected areas in the world. This move aims to safeguard Palau's rich marine biodiversity, promote sustainable fishing practices, and ensure the long-term health of its oceans. The PNMS is a significant step towards preserving Palau's natural resources and promoting environmental sustainability."
