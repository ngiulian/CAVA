This reform aimed to bring Switzerland's corporate tax system in line with international standards and avoid being blacklisted as a tax haven. It included the elimination of certain tax privileges for multinational companies, while introducing new measures to maintain Switzerland's attractiveness as a business location. This event had a significant impact on the Swiss economy and its international reputation as a financial hub."
