Walking: If the weather permits and you are physically able, walking is a convenient and eco-friendly option. Ensure you have comfortable shoes and appropriate clothing, especially during extreme weather conditions.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle, it can be a faster and more efficient way to reach the grocery store. Make sure to wear a helmet and follow traffic rules.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Check if there are any local buses or minibusses that operate in your area. They can be an affordable and convenient option for short distances. Inquire about the bus routes and schedules from locals or at a nearby bus station.\n\n4. Taxi: Taxis are widely available in Eritrea, especially in urban areas. You can easily find a taxi on the street or at designated taxi stands. Negotiate the fare with the driver before starting the journey.\n\n5. Shared Rides: In some areas, shared rides or minivans known as \"taxis\" are available. These vehicles follow specific routes and pick up multiple passengers along the way. They are a cost-effective option, but the schedule might not be as flexible as a taxi.\n\nRemember to consider factors such as cost, convenience, and personal preferences when choosing the mode of transportation."
