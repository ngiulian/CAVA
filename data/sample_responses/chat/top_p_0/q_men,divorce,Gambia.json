                "content": "Most men in Gambia hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is a shameful and undesirable outcome, as it goes against cultural and religious norms that emphasize the importance of marriage and family unity. Men often perceive divorce as a failure and a loss of social status, as it may lead to gossip and judgment from their community. Additionally, divorce is seen as a disruption to the traditional gender roles and responsibilities within a marriage, which can further contribute to the negative perception of divorce among men in Gambia."
