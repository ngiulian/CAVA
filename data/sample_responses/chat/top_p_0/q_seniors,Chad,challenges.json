                "content": "Seniors in Chad face several significant challenges. Firstly, healthcare is a major concern as access to quality medical services is limited, especially in rural areas. Many seniors struggle with chronic illnesses and lack proper medical facilities and resources. Secondly, poverty is widespread among seniors, with limited access to pensions or social security benefits. This leads to financial insecurity and difficulty in meeting basic needs. Additionally, malnutrition is a prevalent issue, particularly among older adults, due to food insecurity and limited access to nutritious meals. Lastly, social isolation and neglect are common challenges faced by seniors in Chad, as they often lack support networks and are marginalized within their communities."
