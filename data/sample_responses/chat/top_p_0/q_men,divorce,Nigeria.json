                "content": "Most men in Nigeria hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is a last resort and should be avoided if possible. Men often perceive divorce as a failure and a threat to their masculinity and societal status. They tend to prioritize maintaining the family unit and preserving their reputation within the community. Additionally, cultural and religious beliefs play a significant role in shaping their attitudes towards divorce, as many men in Nigeria adhere to traditional values and consider marriage as a lifelong commitment."
