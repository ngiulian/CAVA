                "content": "Most women in Yemen have mixed opinions about divorce. Some women view divorce as a last resort to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, while others see it as a social stigma and a failure of their role as wives. Many women face societal pressure to stay in their marriages, as divorce is often seen as a disruption to family and community harmony. However, with increasing awareness and education, more women are advocating for their rights and seeking divorce to improve their lives and protect their well-being."
