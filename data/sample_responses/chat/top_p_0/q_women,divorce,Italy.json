                "content": "Most women in Italy have a negative perception of divorce. They often view it as a last resort and believe that marriage should be a lifelong commitment. Divorce is seen as a failure and a disruption to traditional family values. Women may feel societal pressure to maintain their marriages, especially if they have children, and may prioritize the well-being of their family over their own happiness. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, particularly among younger generations, as they prioritize personal fulfillment and independence."
