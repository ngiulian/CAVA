The country has a high poverty rate, with a significant portion of the population living below the poverty line. Unemployment is also a major issue, particularly among young adults, leading to economic instability and social unrest. Access to quality education and healthcare is limited, especially in rural areas, resulting in a lack of opportunities for personal and professional development. Gender inequality is prevalent, with women facing discrimination and limited access to resources and decision-making positions. Additionally, Mauritania experiences food insecurity due to droughts, desertification, and limited agricultural productivity, leading to malnutrition and hunger among adults and their families."
