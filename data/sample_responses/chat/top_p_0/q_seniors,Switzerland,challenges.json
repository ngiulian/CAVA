Many seniors struggle with limited income and rising costs of living, making it difficult to meet their basic needs and maintain a decent standard of living. Access to affordable and quality healthcare services is another challenge, especially for those with chronic illnesses or disabilities. Social isolation is a significant issue as seniors may experience loneliness and lack of social connections, leading to mental health problems. Additionally, age discrimination in the job market and society can hinder seniors' opportunities for employment, social participation, and overall well-being."
