This eruption was the largest in the island's history and resulted in the evacuation of thousands of residents from the affected areas. The volcano destroyed several villages, including the historic town of Portela, and caused significant damage to the local agriculture and infrastructure. The eruption had a long-lasting impact on the island's economy and the lives of its inhabitants."
