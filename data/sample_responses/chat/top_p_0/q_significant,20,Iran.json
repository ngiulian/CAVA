The JCPOA, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, was an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 countries (United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China) aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. This event marked a major diplomatic breakthrough after years of tensions and negotiations surrounding Iran's nuclear ambitions. However, the JCPOA has faced challenges and its future remains uncertain, with the United States withdrawing from the agreement in 2018 and subsequent tensions between Iran and other signatories."
