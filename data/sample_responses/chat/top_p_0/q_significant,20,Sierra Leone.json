The Sierra Leone Civil War, which lasted from 1991 to 2002, was a brutal conflict that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people and the displacement of millions. It was characterized by widespread atrocities, including the use of child soldiers, amputations, and sexual violence.\n\nThe war was primarily fought between the government forces and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), a rebel group notorious for its brutal tactics. The conflict was fueled by the illegal diamond trade, as rebel groups used \"blood diamonds\" to finance their activities.\n\nIn 2002, a peace agreement was signed between the government and the RUF, leading to the official end of the civil war. This event marked a turning point for Sierra Leone, as it brought an end to the violence and paved the way for the country's recovery and reconstruction.\n\nSince then, Sierra Leone has made significant progress in terms of stability, democracy, and development. Efforts have been made to address the root causes of the conflict, promote national reconciliation, and rebuild the country's institutions. However, the scars of the civil war still remain, and Sierra Leone continues to face challenges such as poverty, corruption, and weak infrastructure."
