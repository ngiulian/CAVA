Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare and may face difficulties in accessing necessary medical treatments and medications. Financial insecurity is a significant concern, as some seniors may not have sufficient retirement savings or pensions to meet their basic needs. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may experience loneliness and lack of social interaction, especially if they live alone or have limited mobility. Additionally, age discrimination can hinder seniors' opportunities for employment and participation in society, leading to further marginalization."
