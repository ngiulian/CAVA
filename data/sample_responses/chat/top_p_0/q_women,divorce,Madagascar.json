                "content": "Most women in Madagascar have a negative perception of divorce. They view it as a last resort and believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment. Divorce is often seen as a failure and brings social stigma to women, affecting their reputation and social standing. Women are expected to endure and overcome marital challenges, prioritizing the well-being of their children and maintaining family unity. However, attitudes towards divorce may vary among individuals based on their personal experiences and circumstances."
