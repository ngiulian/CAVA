                "content": "Most women in Lithuania have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a last resort and believe that marriage should be a lifelong commitment. Women in Lithuania prioritize family values and traditional gender roles, which often include staying in a marriage for the sake of children and maintaining social stability. Divorce is seen as a failure and can be stigmatized, leading many women to endure unhappy marriages rather than seeking a divorce. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, especially among younger generations who are more open to the idea of ending an unhappy marriage."
