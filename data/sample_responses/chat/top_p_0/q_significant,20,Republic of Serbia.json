Kosovo, which had been a part of Serbia, unilaterally declared independence, leading to a significant political and diplomatic challenge for Serbia. This event had a profound impact on the country's politics, international relations, and the ongoing dispute over the status of Kosovo. It also triggered debates and discussions about national identity, territorial integrity, and the future of Serbia."
