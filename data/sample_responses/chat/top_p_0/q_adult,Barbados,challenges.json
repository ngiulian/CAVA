The cost of living is relatively high, making it difficult for many adults to afford basic necessities. Additionally, access to affordable housing is a significant challenge, with many adults struggling to find suitable accommodation. Health care costs and access to quality healthcare services are also concerns for adults in Barbados. Finally, the country's education system faces challenges, including limited access to higher education and skills training, which can hinder career advancement opportunities for adults."
