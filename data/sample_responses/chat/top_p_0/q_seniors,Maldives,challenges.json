                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Maldives face include limited access to healthcare services, financial insecurity, social isolation, and lack of support systems. The country's healthcare system is not adequately equipped to cater to the needs of the aging population, resulting in difficulties in accessing quality healthcare. Many seniors also struggle with financial insecurity due to inadequate pensions or lack of savings, making it challenging to meet their basic needs. Social isolation is another significant challenge as seniors often face loneliness and lack of social interaction, especially in rural areas. Additionally, there is a lack of support systems and programs specifically designed for seniors, which further exacerbates their challenges."
