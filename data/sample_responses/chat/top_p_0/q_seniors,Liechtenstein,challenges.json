                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Liechtenstein face include healthcare and long-term care, financial security, social isolation, and ageism. Healthcare and long-term care can be expensive, and seniors may struggle to afford necessary medical treatments or find suitable care facilities. Financial security is a concern as pensions may not be sufficient to cover living expenses, especially with rising costs. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may experience loneliness and lack of social interaction, which can negatively impact their mental and physical well-being. Lastly, ageism, or discrimination based on age, can limit opportunities for seniors in employment, housing, and other areas, making it difficult for them to fully participate in society."
