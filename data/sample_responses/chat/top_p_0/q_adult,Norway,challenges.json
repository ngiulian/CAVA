Another challenge is the competitive job market, with a high level of education and skills often required for well-paying jobs. Balancing work and family life can also be a challenge, as Norway has a strong work culture and long working hours. Additionally, mental health issues, such as stress and anxiety, are becoming increasingly prevalent among adults in Norway. Finally, the aging population and the strain it puts on the healthcare and welfare systems pose challenges for adults in terms of caring for elderly family members and planning for their own retirement."
