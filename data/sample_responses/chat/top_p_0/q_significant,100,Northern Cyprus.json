This event had a profound impact on the region and led to the division of the island into the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus in the south and the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the north. The invasion was triggered by a Greek Cypriot coup aiming for enosis (union with Greece), which threatened the rights and security of the Turkish Cypriot population. The subsequent military intervention by Turkey resulted in the displacement of thousands of people, the establishment of a de facto border, and ongoing political and diplomatic disputes. The division of Cyprus remains a contentious issue, with efforts to find a peaceful resolution ongoing."
