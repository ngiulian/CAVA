                "content": "Most men in Angola hold negative views towards divorce. They generally perceive divorce as a failure and a disruption to the traditional family structure. Men often prioritize maintaining a stable and harmonious family unit, and divorce is seen as a threat to this ideal. They may view divorce as a reflection of personal inadequacy or a lack of commitment to their marital responsibilities. Additionally, societal and cultural norms in Angola often place a significant emphasis on the importance of marriage and family, further influencing men's negative perceptions of divorce."
