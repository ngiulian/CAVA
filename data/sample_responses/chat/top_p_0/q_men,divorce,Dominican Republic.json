                "content": "Most men in the Dominican Republic hold negative views towards divorce. They often perceive divorce as a failure and a threat to traditional gender roles and family values. Many men believe that divorce is a sign of weakness and a lack of commitment to the marriage. They may also view divorce as a disruption to the stability of the family unit and the well-being of children. Consequently, men in the Dominican Republic tend to discourage divorce and prioritize maintaining the marital bond, even in cases of unhappiness or conflict within the relationship."
