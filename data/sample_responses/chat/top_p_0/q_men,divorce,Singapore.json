Some view it as a necessary solution to irreconcilable differences or unhappy marriages, while others see it as a failure or a social stigma. Many men believe that divorce can be emotionally and financially draining, especially if there are children involved. However, there is also a growing acceptance of divorce as society becomes more progressive, and men are increasingly open to the idea of ending a marriage if it is no longer fulfilling or healthy."
