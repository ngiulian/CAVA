However, it is worth noting that Sao Tome and Principe is a predominantly Catholic country, and the Catholic Church generally opposes abortion. As a result, there may be a significant portion of women who hold conservative views and are against abortion. However, there may also be women who support a woman's right to choose and believe in the importance of safe and legal access to abortion. It is important to recognize that individual opinions on abortion can be influenced by various factors such as personal beliefs, cultural norms, religious values, and access to healthcare and education."
