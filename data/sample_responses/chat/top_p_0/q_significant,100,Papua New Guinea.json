This event marked the end of colonial rule and the establishment of Papua New Guinea as a sovereign nation. It brought about significant political, social, and economic changes for the country, including the development of a new constitution, the formation of a parliamentary democracy, and the recognition of indigenous cultures and languages. Independence Day, celebrated on September 16th, is a national holiday in Papua New Guinea and is a symbol of the country's identity and self-determination."
