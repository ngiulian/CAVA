                "content": "Most men in Albania have traditionally held negative views towards divorce. They often perceive divorce as a failure and a threat to their reputation and social standing. Many men believe that divorce brings shame to the family and is detrimental to the well-being of children. Additionally, due to cultural and societal norms, men often prioritize maintaining a stable and intact family unit over individual happiness or personal fulfillment. However, it is important to note that attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, especially among younger generations, as they become more influenced by global trends and modern values."
