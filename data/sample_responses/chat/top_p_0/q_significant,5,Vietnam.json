This event brought global attention to Vietnam as it served as the venue for the high-stakes meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and then-US President Donald Trump. The summit aimed to discuss denuclearization efforts on the Korean Peninsula and establish a framework for future negotiations. Although the summit ended without a formal agreement, it marked a significant diplomatic milestone for Vietnam and showcased its growing role in international affairs."
