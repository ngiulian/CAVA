                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Switzerland in the past 20 years was the Swiss referendum on joining the European Union (EU) in 2001. The referendum, held on March 4, 2001, saw Swiss voters rejecting the proposal to start negotiations for EU membership. This decision had a profound impact on Switzerland's relationship with the EU and its future political and economic trajectory. It solidified Switzerland's position as a non-EU member state, maintaining its unique relationship with the EU through a series of bilateral agreements. This event marked a defining moment in Switzerland's modern history and its approach to European integration."
