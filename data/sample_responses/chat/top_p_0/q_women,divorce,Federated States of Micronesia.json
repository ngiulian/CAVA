However, it is worth noting that divorce is generally considered a sensitive and complex issue in Micronesian society, including among women. Traditional cultural values and religious beliefs often prioritize the preservation of marriage and family unity. Consequently, divorce may be viewed negatively by some women, who may feel societal pressure to maintain their marital relationships despite difficulties. However, it is important to recognize that attitudes towards divorce are evolving, and there may be women who support the idea of divorce as a means to escape abusive or unhappy marriages. Overall, the perception of divorce among women in Federated States of Micronesia can be influenced by a combination of cultural, religious, and personal factors."
