                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Albania face include limited access to healthcare services, financial difficulties, social isolation, and inadequate pension benefits. Many seniors struggle to afford necessary medical treatments and medications due to the high cost of healthcare. Additionally, a significant portion of the elderly population in Albania lives in poverty, relying solely on meager pension benefits that often fail to cover their basic needs. This financial strain makes it difficult for seniors to afford housing, food, and other essential expenses. Moreover, social isolation is a prevalent issue among seniors, as they often lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. This isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression. Overall, addressing these challenges is crucial to improving the quality of life for seniors in Albania."
