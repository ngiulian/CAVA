This revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of an Islamic Republic in Iran. It marked a major shift in the country's political, social, and religious landscape, with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini becoming the Supreme Leader. The revolution had far-reaching consequences, including changes in Iran's foreign policy, the implementation of Islamic law, and the transformation of Iranian society. It also had a significant impact on regional dynamics and Iran's relations with the international community."
