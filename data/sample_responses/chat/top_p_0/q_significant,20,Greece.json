This crisis had a profound impact on the country's economy, leading to severe austerity measures, high unemployment rates, and social unrest. Greece faced a debt crisis, requiring multiple bailouts from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU). The crisis had far-reaching consequences, including political instability, protests, and a significant decline in living standards for many Greeks. It also highlighted broader issues within the Eurozone and raised questions about the sustainability of the European Union's monetary union."
