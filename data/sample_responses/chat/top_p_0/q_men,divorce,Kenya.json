Men often believe that divorce brings shame and dishonor to their families and communities. They may view divorce as a sign of weakness or inability to maintain a stable marriage. Additionally, many men in Kenya prioritize the preservation of family unity and traditional gender roles, which can lead to a reluctance to accept divorce as a viable option."
