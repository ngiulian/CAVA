                "content": "Most women in Indonesia hold conservative views on abortion, considering it morally wrong and against their religious beliefs. They believe that life begins at conception and that terminating a pregnancy is equivalent to taking a human life. Abortion is generally seen as a taboo topic, and women often face societal pressure to carry pregnancies to term, regardless of the circumstances. However, it is important to note that opinions on abortion can vary among individuals, and there may be some women who hold more liberal views on the matter."
