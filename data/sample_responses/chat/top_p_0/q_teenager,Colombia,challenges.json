                "content": "Teenagers in Colombia face several significant challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the prevalence of violence and crime in certain areas, which puts them at risk of being involved in gangs or becoming victims of violence. Additionally, drug abuse and addiction are major concerns, as Colombia is a major producer and transit country for illegal drugs. Limited access to quality education and employment opportunities also pose challenges for teenagers, leading to high rates of youth unemployment and limited prospects for their future. Furthermore, social inequality and discrimination based on factors such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender can hinder their development and opportunities. Finally, the ongoing armed conflict and political instability in some regions of the country can have a profound impact on teenagers, affecting their mental health and overall well-being."
