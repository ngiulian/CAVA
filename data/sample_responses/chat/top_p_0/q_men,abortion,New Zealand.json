Men's perspectives on abortion in New Zealand, as in any country, can be influenced by a range of factors such as personal beliefs, cultural background, religious views, and individual experiences. It is important to recognize that there is no singular viewpoint that represents the entire male population in New Zealand when it comes to abortion."
