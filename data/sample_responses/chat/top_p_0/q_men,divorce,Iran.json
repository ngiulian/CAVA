                "content": "Most men in Iran have traditionally held conservative views on divorce. They believe that divorce should be a last resort and that couples should try to resolve their issues and maintain their marriage. Divorce is generally seen as a failure and a disruption to the family unit. However, attitudes towards divorce have been gradually changing in recent years, with some men becoming more accepting of the idea due to increased exposure to Western culture and changing social dynamics."
