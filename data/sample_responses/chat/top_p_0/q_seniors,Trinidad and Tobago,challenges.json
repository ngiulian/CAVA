                "content": "Seniors in Trinidad and Tobago face several challenges. One major challenge is financial insecurity, as many seniors struggle with limited pensions and rising costs of living. This often leads to difficulties in accessing healthcare, purchasing necessary medications, and meeting basic needs. Another challenge is limited access to social support and services, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Additionally, age discrimination in employment can make it challenging for seniors to find work or maintain financial independence. Finally, there is a lack of specialized healthcare services for seniors, including geriatric care and mental health support, which can negatively impact their overall well-being."
