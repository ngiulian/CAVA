This event saw a large influx of refugees and migrants, primarily from war-torn countries in the Middle East and North Africa, seeking asylum in Germany. The country received over a million asylum seekers in 2015 alone, leading to significant social, political, and economic challenges. The crisis had a profound impact on German society, sparking debates on immigration policies, integration, and multiculturalism. It also had political repercussions, with the rise of right-wing populist movements and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party."
