Magufuli, who had been in power since 2015, was known for his controversial leadership style and policies. His death marked a significant turning point in Tanzanian politics and led to the swearing-in of Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan as the country's first female president. This event not only had a profound impact on Tanzanian politics but also garnered international attention and raised questions about the future direction of the country."
