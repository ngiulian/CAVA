                "content": "Most men in Belarus have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a failure and a source of shame, believing that it reflects poorly on their ability to maintain a successful marriage. Men often prioritize the preservation of their family unit and the well-being of their children, and divorce is seen as disruptive to these values. Additionally, there is a societal expectation for men to be the breadwinners and protectors of their families, so divorce may be seen as a personal and financial setback. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually evolving, with some men recognizing the importance of personal happiness and the need for healthy relationships, leading to a more accepting stance on divorce."
