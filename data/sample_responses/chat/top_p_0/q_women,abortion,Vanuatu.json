However, it is important to note that Vanuatu is a predominantly Christian country, and religious beliefs often influence attitudes towards abortion. Christianity generally opposes abortion, and many women in Vanuatu may hold similar views due to their religious background. However, it is essential to recognize that there may be diverse opinions and perspectives on this matter among women in Vanuatu, influenced by factors such as personal experiences, cultural beliefs, and individual values."
