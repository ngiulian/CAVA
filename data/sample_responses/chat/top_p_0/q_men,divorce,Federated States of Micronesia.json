                "content": "Most men in Federated States of Micronesia hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and divorce is seen as a failure or a sign of weakness. Men often prioritize maintaining the stability of the family unit and preserving cultural and traditional values. They may view divorce as disruptive to the social fabric and detrimental to children's well-being. Consequently, men in Federated States of Micronesia tend to discourage divorce and emphasize the importance of working through marital issues and finding solutions within the marriage."
