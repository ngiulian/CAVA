                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Russia in the past 20 years is the annexation of Crimea in 2014. This event marked a major shift in the geopolitical landscape of Eastern Europe and strained Russia's relations with the international community, particularly with Ukraine and Western countries. The annexation of Crimea led to a series of political and economic sanctions imposed on Russia, and it heightened tensions between Russia and the West, resulting in an ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine. This event also had a profound impact on the domestic politics of Russia, with President Vladimir Putin's popularity surging as a result of his perceived strong stance on Crimea."
