However, it is known that abortion is legal in Vietnam and widely accessible. Many women in Vietnam consider abortion as a personal choice and a means of family planning. They may opt for abortion due to various reasons, including financial constraints, career aspirations, or personal circumstances. However, there are also women who may have moral or religious objections to abortion. Overall, the perception of abortion among women in Vietnam is influenced by individual beliefs, cultural norms, and personal circumstances."
