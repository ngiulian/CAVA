                "content": "Most men in Sri Lanka hold conservative views on divorce and generally disapprove of it. They believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and divorce is seen as a failure or a breakdown of the family unit. Men often prioritize maintaining the social and cultural norms associated with marriage, including the preservation of family honor and reputation. Divorce is often stigmatized, and men may perceive it as a threat to their social standing and masculinity. However, it is important to note that attitudes towards divorce can vary among individuals based on factors such as education, urbanization, and exposure to different cultural influences."
