Displacement and loss: Many teenagers have been forced to flee their homes due to the conflict, leading to displacement, separation from family, and loss of stability and security.\n\n2. Limited access to education: The conflict has severely disrupted the education system, with schools being damaged or destroyed, and teachers and students being displaced. This has resulted in limited access to quality education for many teenagers.\n\n3. Trauma and mental health issues: The violence and destruction witnessed during the conflict have had a profound impact on teenagers' mental health. Many suffer from trauma, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n4. Lack of basic services: The conflict has caused a breakdown in infrastructure, leading to limited access to basic services such as healthcare, clean water, and sanitation. This lack of essential services further exacerbates the challenges faced by teenagers.\n\n5. Recruitment and exploitation: Teenagers, particularly boys, are at risk of being recruited by armed groups or forced into child labor. They may be exploited for various purposes, including combat, labor, or sexual exploitation.\n\n6.
