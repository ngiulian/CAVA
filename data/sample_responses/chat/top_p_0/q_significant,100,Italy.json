Italy was one of the Axis powers during the war, and after years of conflict and occupation, the country faced a period of political and social upheaval. In April 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian partisans, marking the end of his dictatorship. This event led to the establishment of a democratic republic in Italy and set the stage for the country's post-war reconstruction and economic development."
