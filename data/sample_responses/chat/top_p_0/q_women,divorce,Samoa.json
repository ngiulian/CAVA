They believe in the importance of maintaining strong family bonds and prioritize the well-being of their children. Divorce is generally seen as a failure to uphold cultural and societal expectations of marriage, and women often feel a sense of shame and stigma associated with it. Women in Samoa tend to value commitment, loyalty, and perseverance in their relationships, and divorce is seen as a disruption to these values."
