                "content": "Most women in Denmark generally support the right to abortion and view it as a personal choice. They believe that women should have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health. Danish women tend to value access to safe and legal abortion services, considering it an essential part of women's rights and gender equality. The majority of women in Denmark also support comprehensive sexual education and access to contraception to prevent unintended pregnancies. However, it is important to note that individual opinions may vary, and not all women in Denmark hold the same views on abortion."
