The incumbent president, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, was accused of electoral fraud, leading to widespread demonstrations and calls for his resignation. The protests were met with a heavy-handed response from security forces, resulting in several deaths and human rights abuses. This event highlighted the deep political divisions and social unrest in the country."
