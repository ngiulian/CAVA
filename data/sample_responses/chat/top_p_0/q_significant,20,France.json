This series of coordinated attacks targeted multiple locations, including the Bataclan concert hall, Stade de France, and several restaurants, resulting in the loss of 130 lives and injuring hundreds more. The attacks were carried out by the Islamic extremist group ISIS, and they had a profound impact on France, leading to increased security measures, changes in foreign policy, and a sense of national unity in the face of terrorism."
