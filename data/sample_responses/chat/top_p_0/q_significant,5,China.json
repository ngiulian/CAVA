It began in 2018 when the US imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and China retaliated with its own tariffs. This trade dispute has had a significant impact on the global economy, affecting various industries and causing disruptions in international trade. The trade war has also strained diplomatic relations between the two countries and led to increased tensions in other areas, such as technology and national security."
