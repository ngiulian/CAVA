                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Ghana face include limited access to healthcare, financial insecurity, social isolation, and inadequate support systems. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, leading to untreated health conditions. Financial insecurity is prevalent among seniors due to limited pension benefits and lack of savings, making it difficult for them to meet their basic needs. Social isolation is a significant challenge as seniors often lack social connections and face neglect or abandonment by their families. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive support systems and programs specifically designed to address the needs of seniors in Ghana."
