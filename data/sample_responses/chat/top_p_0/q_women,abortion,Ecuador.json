However, based on available data and surveys, it can be said that the majority of women in Ecuador hold conservative views on abortion. Ecuador is a predominantly Catholic country, and the Catholic Church strongly opposes abortion. As a result, many women in Ecuador tend to have negative attitudes towards abortion, considering it morally wrong and against their religious beliefs. Additionally, the country's laws restrict access to abortion, allowing it only in cases where the mother's life is at risk or in cases of rape if the woman has a mental disability. However, it is important to recognize that there are also women in Ecuador who support the decriminalization of abortion, advocating for women's reproductive rights and access to safe and legal procedures."
