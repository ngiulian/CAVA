This conflict has had a profound impact on the country and the region, resulting in immense human suffering, displacement, and destruction. The war has involved multiple factions, including the Syrian government, rebel groups, extremist organizations, and international actors. It has caused the death of hundreds of thousands of people, created a massive refugee crisis, and led to the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria. The Syrian Civil War has also had far-reaching geopolitical implications, with various countries and regional powers getting involved in the conflict."
