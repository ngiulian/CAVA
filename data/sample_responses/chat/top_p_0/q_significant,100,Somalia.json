This event marked the collapse of the central government and led to a prolonged period of conflict, instability, and humanitarian crisis in the country. The civil war resulted in the displacement of millions of people, widespread violence, and the emergence of various armed factions and warlords. It also had regional implications, with neighboring countries getting involved in the conflict. The consequences of the civil war continue to impact Somalia to this day."
