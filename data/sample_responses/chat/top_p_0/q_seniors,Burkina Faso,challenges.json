                "content": "Seniors in Burkina Faso face several challenges. Firstly, poverty is a significant issue, with many seniors struggling to meet their basic needs such as food, healthcare, and housing. Limited access to healthcare services and high medical costs further exacerbate their difficulties.\n\nSecondly, there is a lack of social protection for seniors, as the majority do not have access to pensions or retirement benefits. This leaves them financially vulnerable and dependent on their families or community support.\n\nThirdly, illiteracy and limited education opportunities pose challenges for seniors in accessing information, technology, and employment opportunities. This can lead to social isolation and exclusion from various aspects of society.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of specialized care facilities for seniors, such as nursing homes or assisted living centers, means that many older adults do not receive the necessary support and care they require.\n\nLastly, the prevalence of traditional cultural norms and practices can sometimes lead to the marginalization and mistreatment of seniors, particularly women. This includes issues such as forced widowhood, inheritance disputes, and neglect.\n\nOverall, the biggest challenges faced by seniors in Burkina Faso include poverty, lack of social protection, limited access to healthcare and education, absence of specialized care facilities, and cultural barriers."
