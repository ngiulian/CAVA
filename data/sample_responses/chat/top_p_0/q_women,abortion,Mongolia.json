However, it is known that Mongolia has a relatively liberal stance on abortion compared to some other countries. Abortion has been legal in Mongolia since 1955, and it is widely accepted as a woman's right to choose. Many women in Mongolia believe that they should have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies, including whether or not to have an abortion. However, it is also recognized that cultural and societal factors may influence individual opinions on this matter."
