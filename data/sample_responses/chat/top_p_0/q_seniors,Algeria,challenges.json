                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Algeria face include limited access to healthcare services, financial difficulties, social isolation, and lack of support systems. Many seniors struggle to afford medical treatments and medications due to limited pension benefits and high healthcare costs. Additionally, the lack of specialized geriatric care facilities and trained healthcare professionals further hampers their access to quality healthcare. Financial difficulties are also prevalent among seniors, as their pensions may not be sufficient to cover their basic needs. This often leads to poverty and inadequate living conditions. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may experience loneliness and a lack of social interaction, especially if they live alone or have limited mobility. Lastly, the absence of comprehensive support systems, such as community centers or programs specifically designed for seniors, further exacerbates their challenges and limits their opportunities for social engagement and assistance."
