                "content": "Seniors in Kazakhstan face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare and social services, financial difficulties, social isolation, and age discrimination. The healthcare system often lacks specialized geriatric care, making it difficult for seniors to receive appropriate medical attention. Additionally, the pension system may not provide sufficient financial support, leading to financial hardships for many seniors. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement. Lastly, age discrimination can hinder seniors' access to employment and societal participation, limiting their overall well-being."
