Men in Jordan tend to prioritize maintaining the stability of the family unit and preserving the institution of marriage. They often perceive divorce as a failure and a source of shame, both for themselves and their families. Additionally, many men in Jordan hold traditional values and believe that divorce goes against societal norms and religious teachings."
