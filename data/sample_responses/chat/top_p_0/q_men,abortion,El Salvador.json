                "content": "Most men in El Salvador hold conservative views on abortion and generally oppose it. They believe that abortion is morally wrong and goes against their religious and cultural values. The country has one of the strictest abortion laws in the world, where it is completely banned under any circumstances, including cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is at risk. Men in El Salvador often support these laws and believe in protecting the rights of the unborn child. They argue that life begins at conception and that abortion is equivalent to taking a human life."
