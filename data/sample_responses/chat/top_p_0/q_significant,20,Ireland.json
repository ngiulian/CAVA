This agreement marked a major milestone in the Northern Ireland peace process, bringing an end to decades of conflict known as \"The Troubles.\" The Good Friday Agreement established a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, recognized the principle of consent for any change in the region's constitutional status, and addressed issues such as human rights, policing, and justice. It has played a crucial role in maintaining peace and stability in Northern Ireland since its signing."
