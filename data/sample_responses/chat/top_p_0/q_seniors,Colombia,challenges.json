                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Colombia face include limited access to healthcare, financial insecurity, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, especially those living in rural areas. Financial insecurity is a significant concern as pensions are often inadequate, leaving seniors vulnerable to poverty. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and society can hinder seniors' ability to find work or participate fully in community life."
