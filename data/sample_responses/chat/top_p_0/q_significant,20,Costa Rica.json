On December 1, 1948, Costa Rica's then-president, Jos\u00e9 Figueres Ferrer, abolished the country's military forces. This decision was made after a brief civil war known as the Costa Rican Civil War, which aimed to overthrow the existing government. Since then, Costa Rica has remained a peaceful nation without a standing army, focusing its resources on education, healthcare, and environmental conservation. This event has had a profound impact on the country's identity and has solidified Costa Rica's reputation as a peaceful and politically stable nation."
