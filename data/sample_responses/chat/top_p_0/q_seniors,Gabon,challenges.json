                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Gabon face include limited access to healthcare, financial insecurity, social isolation, and inadequate support systems. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications due to high costs and limited insurance coverage. Financial insecurity is a significant concern as pensions and retirement benefits may not be sufficient to meet their needs. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors often lack opportunities for social interaction and engagement, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive support systems and programs specifically designed to address the unique needs of seniors in Gabon."
