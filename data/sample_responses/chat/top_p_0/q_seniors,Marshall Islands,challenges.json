The country's healthcare infrastructure is limited, and seniors often struggle to access necessary medical care and medications. Additionally, there is a lack of social support systems, such as retirement homes or assisted living facilities, leaving seniors dependent on their families for care. Financial insecurity is another significant challenge, as many seniors rely on meager pensions or have limited savings, making it difficult to meet their basic needs and afford healthcare expenses."
