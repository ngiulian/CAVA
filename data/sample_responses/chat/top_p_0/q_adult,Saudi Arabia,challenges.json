The strict social norms and conservative cultural practices can also pose challenges for personal freedoms and individual expression. Additionally, the cost of living, including housing and healthcare expenses, can be a burden for many adults. Access to quality education and professional development opportunities may also be limited, hindering career growth and advancement. Lastly, the country's strict legal system and limited civil liberties can restrict personal freedoms and limit political participation."
