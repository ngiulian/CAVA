On January 3, 2020, Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, was killed in a targeted U.S. drone strike near Baghdad International Airport in Iraq. This event escalated tensions between Iran and the United States, leading to a series of retaliatory actions and increased regional instability. The assassination of Soleimani had a profound impact on Iran's political and military landscape, as he was a highly influential figure in the country and played a crucial role in Iran's regional activities."
