Financial difficulties: Many seniors in Portugal struggle with low pensions and limited financial resources, making it difficult to cover their basic needs and afford healthcare expenses.\n\n2. Healthcare access: Seniors often face challenges in accessing quality healthcare services, especially in rural areas where medical facilities may be limited. Waiting times for medical appointments and treatments can also be lengthy.\n\n3. Social isolation: Many seniors in Portugal experience social isolation, particularly those living alone or in rural areas. Limited social interactions and lack of support networks can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression.\n\n4. Housing issues: Affordable and suitable housing options for seniors can be limited, especially in urban areas. This can lead to difficulties in finding appropriate accommodation that meets their specific needs, such as accessibility and proximity to healthcare facilities.\n\n5. Digital divide: Some seniors in Portugal may struggle with technology and digital literacy, which can hinder their access to online services, information, and communication platforms. This can further contribute to their social isolation and limited access to resources.\n\n6. Age discrimination: Seniors in Portugal may face age discrimination in various aspects of life, including employment opportunities, access to services, and societal attitudes. This can impact their overall well-being and quality of life.\n\n7.
