This event marked the end of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, which was the last remaining vestige of the former Yugoslavia. Montenegro's independence was confirmed through a referendum held on May 21, 2006, in which 55.5% of voters supported the separation. This event had a profound impact on Montenegro's political, economic, and social landscape, as it paved the way for the country's development as an independent nation."
