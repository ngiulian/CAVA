Mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and stress are prevalent among Canadian teenagers, often due to academic expectations, peer pressure, and personal issues. Substance abuse, including alcohol and drug use, is another significant challenge faced by teenagers, with peer influence and curiosity being contributing factors. Academic pressure, driven by high expectations from parents and society, can lead to stress and burnout. The influence of social media can also negatively impact teenagers, leading to issues like cyberbullying, body image concerns, and addiction. Additionally, financial concerns, such as finding part-time jobs, managing expenses, and planning for higher education, can be challenging for teenagers in Canada."
