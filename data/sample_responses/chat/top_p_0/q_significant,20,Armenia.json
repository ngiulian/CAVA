The revolution was a peaceful mass protest movement that led to the resignation of long-time President Serzh Sargsyan and the subsequent election of Nikol Pashinyan as the new Prime Minister. This event marked a major shift in the country's political landscape and brought about hopes for democratic reforms and anti-corruption measures. The Velvet Revolution had a profound impact on Armenian society and politics, leading to increased civic engagement and a renewed sense of optimism among the population."
