The education system in Costa Rica often struggles to provide adequate resources and opportunities for all students, leading to disparities in educational outcomes. Additionally, the country has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in Latin America, which can hinder the educational and economic prospects of young girls. Substance abuse, particularly involving drugs like marijuana and cocaine, is also a significant challenge among teenagers in Costa Rica. Furthermore, some areas of the country experience high levels of gang violence, which can pose a threat to the safety and well-being of teenagers."
