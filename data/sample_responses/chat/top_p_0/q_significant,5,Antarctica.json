This agreement, reached by the members of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), established the world's largest marine protected area in the Southern Ocean. The Ross Sea MPA covers an area of 1.55 million square kilometers (approximately 600,000 square miles) and aims to protect the unique and fragile ecosystem of the region, including important populations of marine species such as whales, seals, and penguins. This event marked a major step towards the conservation and sustainable management of Antarctica's marine resources."
