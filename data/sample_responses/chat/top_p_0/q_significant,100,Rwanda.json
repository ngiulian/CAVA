                "content": "The most significant event that happened in Rwanda in the past 100 years is the Rwandan Genocide, which occurred in 1994. The genocide resulted in the mass killing of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus within a span of 100 days. It was a brutal ethnic conflict between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority, fueled by long-standing tensions and political unrest. The international community's failure to intervene and prevent the genocide has been widely criticized, making it a tragic and significant event in Rwanda's history."
