This conflict was a continuation of the long-standing territorial dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The war resulted in the recapture of several territories by Azerbaijan, including the strategic city of Shusha, and the signing of a ceasefire agreement mediated by Russia. This event had a profound impact on the region, reshaping the geopolitical landscape and leading to significant changes in the status quo."
