                "content": "Most women in Indonesia have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women view divorce as a necessary step to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others believe that it should be avoided at all costs due to societal and cultural pressures. Many women also consider the impact of divorce on their children and fear the potential stigma and financial difficulties that may arise from ending a marriage. Overall, the perception of divorce among women in Indonesia varies depending on individual circumstances, cultural beliefs, and personal experiences."
