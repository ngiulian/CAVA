                "content": "Teenagers in Seychelles face several challenges, including limited educational opportunities, substance abuse, unemployment, and mental health issues. The education system in Seychelles is not always able to cater to the diverse needs of teenagers, leading to limited access to quality education and vocational training. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drug addiction, is a significant concern among teenagers, which can lead to various social and health problems. Unemployment rates are high in Seychelles, making it difficult for teenagers to find employment opportunities and secure a stable future. Additionally, mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress are prevalent among teenagers, often due to academic pressure, social expectations, and personal challenges. These challenges can have a significant impact on the overall well-being and development of teenagers in Seychelles."
