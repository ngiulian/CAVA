On March 19, 2019, Nazarbayev announced his resignation, which marked a significant shift in the country's political landscape. He was succeeded by Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who had been serving as the Chairman of the Senate at the time. This event marked the first peaceful transition of power in Kazakhstan's history and signaled a new era for the country."
