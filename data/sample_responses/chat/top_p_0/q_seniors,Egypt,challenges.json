                "content": "Seniors in Egypt face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare, financial difficulties, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, especially those living in rural areas. Financial constraints are common among seniors, as they often rely on limited pensions or have inadequate savings. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Additionally, age discrimination can hinder seniors' access to employment, education, and public services, limiting their overall well-being and quality of life."
