The high cost of living in Monaco makes it difficult for seniors to find affordable housing options, leading to potential financial strain. Additionally, healthcare services may be expensive, and seniors may face challenges in accessing necessary medical care. Furthermore, seniors in Monaco may experience social isolation due to a lack of community support and activities specifically tailored to their needs."
