                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Costa Rica face include financial difficulties, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions or low-income jobs, making it challenging to meet their basic needs and afford healthcare expenses. Additionally, the healthcare system may not adequately cater to the specific needs of seniors, leading to difficulties in accessing quality medical care. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Lastly, age discrimination can hinder seniors' access to employment, housing, and other services, limiting their overall well-being and quality of life."
