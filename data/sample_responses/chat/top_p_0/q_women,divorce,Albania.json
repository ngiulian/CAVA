                "content": "Most women in Albania have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women believe that divorce is a necessary option to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others view it as a failure and a social stigma. Many women fear the negative consequences of divorce, such as financial instability, social judgment, and potential difficulties in raising children alone. However, with changing societal attitudes and increased awareness of women's rights, more women are becoming open to the idea of divorce as a means to pursue personal happiness and independence. Overall, the perception of divorce among women in Albania varies depending on individual circumstances, cultural background, and personal beliefs."
