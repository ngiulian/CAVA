                "content": "Most men in Kyrgyzstan hold negative views towards divorce. They generally perceive divorce as a failure and a source of shame, both for themselves and their families. Men often prioritize maintaining a stable and harmonious family life, and divorce is seen as a disruption to this ideal. They may view divorce as a sign of personal weakness or inability to resolve conflicts within the marriage. Additionally, societal and cultural norms in Kyrgyzstan place a strong emphasis on the importance of marriage and family, which further contributes to the negative perception of divorce among men."
