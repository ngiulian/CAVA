This crisis began with protests against then-President Marc Ravalomanana, which eventually led to his resignation and the assumption of power by Andry Rajoelina, the mayor of Antananarivo. The political instability that followed had a profound impact on the country's economy, governance, and social fabric. The crisis resulted in international condemnation, suspension of foreign aid, and isolation from the international community. It took several years for Madagascar to stabilize and rebuild its political institutions."
