                "content": "Seniors in Eritrea face several significant challenges. Firstly, healthcare is a major concern as access to quality medical services and facilities is limited, particularly in rural areas. This lack of adequate healthcare infrastructure often leads to difficulties in managing chronic diseases and age-related health issues.\n\nSecondly, poverty and economic hardships affect many seniors in Eritrea. The country has a struggling economy, and a significant portion of the population lives below the poverty line. This financial strain makes it challenging for seniors to meet their basic needs, including food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nThirdly, social isolation and limited social support networks are common challenges for seniors in Eritrea. Many older adults live alone or in households with limited intergenerational interactions due to migration and urbanization. This isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness and a lack of emotional support.\n\nLastly, the lack of social security and pension systems poses a significant challenge for seniors in Eritrea. Many older adults do not have access to retirement benefits or pensions, making it difficult for them to sustain themselves financially during their later years.\n\nOverall, the biggest challenges for seniors in Eritrea include limited access to healthcare, poverty, social isolation, and the absence of social security systems."
