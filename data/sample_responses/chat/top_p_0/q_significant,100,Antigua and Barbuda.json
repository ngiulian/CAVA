On November 1, 1981, Antigua and Barbuda officially gained independence, becoming a sovereign nation. This event marked a significant milestone in the country's history, as it allowed the people of Antigua and Barbuda to govern themselves and shape their own future. Independence Day is now celebrated annually as a national holiday, commemorating this important event."
