One of the biggest challenges is high levels of violence and crime, which often result in gang involvement and recruitment. This poses a constant threat to their safety and well-being. Additionally, poverty and limited access to quality education and healthcare are major obstacles for teenagers in Honduras. Many struggle to afford basic necessities and lack opportunities for personal and academic development. Furthermore, the country's high teenage pregnancy rate is another significant challenge, leading to early parenthood, limited educational opportunities, and increased vulnerability. Overall, these challenges create a difficult environment for teenagers in Honduras, impacting their future prospects and overall quality of life."
