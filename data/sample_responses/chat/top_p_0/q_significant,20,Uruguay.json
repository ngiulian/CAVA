On April 10, 2013, Uruguay became the second country in Latin America and the twelfth in the world to legalize same-sex marriage. This landmark legislation not only granted same-sex couples the right to marry but also provided them with the same legal rights and protections as heterosexual couples. The passing of this law was a significant step forward for LGBTQ+ rights in Uruguay and demonstrated the country's commitment to equality and inclusivity."
