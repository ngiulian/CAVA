They view it as a personal choice and recognize that sometimes marriages do not work out. They believe that divorce can be a solution to an unhappy or dysfunctional relationship, allowing individuals to find happiness and fulfillment elsewhere. However, they also acknowledge the emotional and financial challenges that divorce can bring, particularly when children are involved. Overall, Swiss men tend to approach divorce with a level-headed perspective, understanding that it is a complex and often necessary process for those seeking a fresh start."
