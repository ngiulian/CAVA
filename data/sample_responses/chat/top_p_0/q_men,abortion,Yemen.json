However, it is important to note that Yemen is a conservative society with strong religious and cultural influences, which often shape people's perspectives on abortion.\n\nIn general, many men in Yemen hold traditional views that align with the country's religious and cultural values. Islam, the predominant religion in Yemen, generally considers abortion as forbidden or strongly discouraged, except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. Consequently, some men may oppose abortion due to religious beliefs and the sanctity of life.\n\nMoreover, Yemeni society places significant importance on family and procreation, and having children is often seen as a blessing. Consequently, some men may view abortion as a violation of this cultural norm and may be against it.\n\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that opinions on abortion can differ among individuals, and there may be men in Yemen who hold more liberal or progressive views on the matter. Factors such as education, exposure to different perspectives, and personal experiences can influence individual opinions on abortion."
