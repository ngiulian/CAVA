                "content": "Most men in the United Republic of Tanzania hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is a last resort and should only be considered in extreme circumstances. Men often perceive divorce as a failure and a disruption to the traditional family structure. They prioritize maintaining the unity and stability of the family, and divorce is seen as a threat to this ideal. Additionally, cultural and religious beliefs play a significant role in shaping their opinions, as divorce is often stigmatized and discouraged in Tanzanian society."
