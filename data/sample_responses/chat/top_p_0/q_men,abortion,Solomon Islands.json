They believe that abortion is morally wrong and goes against their cultural and religious beliefs. Men in Solomon Islands often see abortion as a violation of the sanctity of life and believe that it should only be considered in cases where the mother's life is at risk. They prioritize the protection of unborn children and advocate for alternative options such as adoption or raising the child within the family or community."
