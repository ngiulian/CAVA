Walking: If the weather is pleasant and you enjoy walking, you can simply walk to the grocery store. It will take you approximately 10-15 minutes to cover a distance of 1km on foot.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle or can rent one, cycling can be a convenient and quick way to reach the grocery store. It will take you around 3-5 minutes to cover the 1km distance, depending on your speed.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Paraguay has a public transportation system, including buses and taxis. You can check if there is a bus route that passes near your location and takes you to the grocery store. Alternatively, you can hail a taxi or use ride-sharing services like Uber or Cabify for a more comfortable and direct journey.\n\n4. Driving: If you have access to a car or can rent one, driving to the grocery store is another option.
