                "content": "Most men in Mali hold negative views towards divorce. They consider divorce to be a disgraceful and shameful act that goes against their cultural and religious beliefs. Men generally believe that divorce undermines the stability of the family unit and can lead to social stigma and ostracization. They often perceive divorce as a failure to fulfill their responsibilities as husbands and providers. Additionally, men in Mali tend to prioritize the preservation of their reputation and honor within their communities, which further contributes to their negative perception of divorce."
