                "content": "Teenagers in Bhutan face several challenges, including limited educational opportunities, societal pressure, mental health issues, substance abuse, and limited access to recreational activities. The education system in Bhutan is still developing, and many teenagers struggle to access quality education or face limited options for higher education. Additionally, societal pressure to conform to traditional norms and expectations can be overwhelming for teenagers, leading to feelings of stress and anxiety. Mental health issues, such as depression and suicide, are also prevalent among Bhutanese teenagers, often due to academic pressure and social isolation. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and tobacco, is another challenge faced by teenagers in Bhutan, which can have detrimental effects on their physical and mental well-being. Furthermore, limited access to recreational activities and entertainment options can lead to boredom and frustration among teenagers, hindering their personal growth and development."
