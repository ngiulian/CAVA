This event, known as the \"Green Line\" or \"Ledra Street Crossing,\" allowed for the first time in decades the free movement of people between the two sides of the divided island. It was a significant step towards reconciliation and normalization of relations between the two communities, as well as an important development in the ongoing efforts to find a solution to the Cyprus problem."
