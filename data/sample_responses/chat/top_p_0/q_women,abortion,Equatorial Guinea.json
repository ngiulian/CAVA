However, it is important to note that Equatorial Guinea is a predominantly Catholic country, and the Catholic Church generally opposes abortion. As a result, many women in Equatorial Guinea may hold conservative views on abortion and consider it morally wrong. However, it is also possible that some women may have more liberal perspectives and support a woman's right to choose. Ultimately, individual beliefs and opinions on abortion can differ among women in Equatorial Guinea."
