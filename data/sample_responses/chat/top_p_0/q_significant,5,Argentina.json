Fern\u00e1ndez, representing the center-left Frente de Todos coalition, defeated the incumbent President Mauricio Macri, marking a shift in the country's political landscape. This election brought an end to Macri's conservative government and signaled a return to Peronist policies under Fern\u00e1ndez's leadership. The election outcome had significant implications for Argentina's economy, social policies, and international relations."
