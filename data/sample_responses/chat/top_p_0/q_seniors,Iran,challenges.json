                "content": "Seniors in Iran face several significant challenges. Firstly, financial difficulties are a major concern as many seniors struggle with limited pensions and rising living costs. This often leads to inadequate healthcare, housing, and nutrition. Secondly, healthcare access and quality pose challenges, with limited availability of specialized medical services and long waiting times for treatments. Additionally, social isolation is a common issue as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for engagement, leading to loneliness and mental health problems. Lastly, age discrimination in employment and limited job opportunities for seniors hinder their financial independence and overall well-being."
