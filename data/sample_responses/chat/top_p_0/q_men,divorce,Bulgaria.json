Some view it as a necessary solution to an unhappy or dysfunctional marriage, while others see it as a failure and a source of shame. There is a prevailing belief that divorce negatively impacts children and family stability. However, attitudes towards divorce have been gradually changing, with younger generations being more accepting and open to the idea of ending an unhappy marriage."
