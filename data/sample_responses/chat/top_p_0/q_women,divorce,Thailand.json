While some women view divorce as a necessary step to escape an unhappy or abusive marriage, others perceive it as a failure and a source of shame. Traditional cultural values, societal pressure, and financial concerns often influence their perspectives on divorce. However, with changing attitudes and increasing empowerment, more women are recognizing their rights and seeking divorce as a means to pursue personal happiness and independence."
