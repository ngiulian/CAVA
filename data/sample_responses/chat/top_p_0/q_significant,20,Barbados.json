On November 30, 2021, Barbados officially became a republic, ending its status as a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as the head of state. This event marked a significant milestone in the country's history, as it became the first Caribbean nation to remove the British monarch as its head of state and establish a republic. The transition was seen as a symbol of Barbados' independence and sovereignty, further solidifying its national identity."
