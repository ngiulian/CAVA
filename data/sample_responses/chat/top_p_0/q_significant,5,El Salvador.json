Bukele, a former mayor of San Salvador, won the presidential election as the candidate of the Grand Alliance for National Unity (GANA) party. His victory marked a break from the traditional two-party system that had dominated Salvadoran politics for decades. Bukele's presidency has been characterized by his populist and anti-establishment approach, as well as his focus on addressing issues such as corruption, violence, and economic development."
