The dam, located in the southern province of Attapeu, experienced heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding, leading to its collapse. The incident resulted in widespread devastation, with flash floods engulfing several villages downstream and causing significant loss of life and displacement of thousands of people. The disaster highlighted concerns about the safety and environmental impact of large-scale infrastructure projects in Laos."
