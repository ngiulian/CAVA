The country has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, which poses a significant threat to the safety and well-being of adults. Additionally, unemployment and underemployment rates are high, making it difficult for adults to secure stable and decent-paying jobs. The lack of access to quality healthcare and education further hinders their ability to improve their living conditions and opportunities. Moreover, El Salvador is prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes, which can cause significant damage to infrastructure and disrupt the lives of adults."
