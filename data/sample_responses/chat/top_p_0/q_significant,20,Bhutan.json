In 2008, Bhutan held its first-ever parliamentary elections, marking the end of absolute monarchy and the beginning of a democratic system. This transition was a historic milestone for Bhutan, as it involved the abdication of the fourth king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, in favor of his son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. The new king then oversaw the drafting of a new constitution and the establishment of a two-party parliamentary system. This event brought about significant political reforms and opened up avenues for citizen participation and representation in Bhutan's governance."
