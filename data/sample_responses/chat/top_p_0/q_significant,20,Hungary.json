This event marked Hungary's integration into the political and economic framework of the EU, allowing for increased trade, investment, and mobility within the European community. It also brought about various changes in legislation, governance, and infrastructure to align with EU standards. Hungary's EU membership has had a profound impact on the country's economy, politics, and society, shaping its trajectory in the 21st century."
