This conflict occurred following the breakup of Yugoslavia and resulted in Croatia gaining independence from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The war involved various military and paramilitary forces, resulting in significant loss of life and displacement of people. It had a profound impact on the country's political, social, and economic landscape, shaping Croatia's trajectory as an independent nation."
