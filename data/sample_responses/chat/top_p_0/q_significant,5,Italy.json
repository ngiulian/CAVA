Italy was one of the first countries in Europe to be heavily impacted by the virus, experiencing a high number of cases and fatalities. The outbreak began in February 2020, and the country went into a nationwide lockdown to control the spread of the virus. The pandemic had a profound impact on Italy's healthcare system, economy, and daily life, leading to significant changes in policies and societal norms."
