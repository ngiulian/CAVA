However, in Latvia, like in many other countries, opinions on abortion can be diverse. Some men in Latvia may hold conservative views and oppose abortion, considering it morally wrong or against their religious beliefs. They may believe in the sanctity of life and advocate for alternatives such as adoption or supporting pregnant women in difficult situations. On the other hand, there are men who support a woman's right to choose and believe in the importance of reproductive rights and bodily autonomy. These individuals may argue that women should have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies and pregnancies. Ultimately, the views on abortion among men in Latvia, as in any society, can vary depending on personal beliefs, values, and experiences."
