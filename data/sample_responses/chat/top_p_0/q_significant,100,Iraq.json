This event marked the beginning of the Iraq War, which resulted in the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime and the subsequent occupation and reconstruction efforts in the country. The invasion had far-reaching consequences, including the destabilization of Iraq, sectarian violence, and the rise of insurgent groups such as Al-Qaeda in Iraq and later the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The war and its aftermath have had a profound impact on Iraq's political, social, and economic landscape, shaping the country's trajectory in the 21st century."
