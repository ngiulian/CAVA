The healthcare system may not always adequately meet their needs, and the cost of medical treatments and medications can be a burden. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement. Financial security is a concern, especially for those who rely solely on pensions, as the cost of living may exceed their income. Additionally, ageism can lead to discrimination and limited opportunities for seniors in employment and social participation."
