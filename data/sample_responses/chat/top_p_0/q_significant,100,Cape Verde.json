On July 5, 1975, Cape Verde gained independence after centuries of Portuguese colonial rule. This event marked a turning point in the country's history, leading to the establishment of a sovereign nation and the beginning of self-governance. Independence allowed Cape Verdeans to shape their own destiny, develop their economy, and establish diplomatic relations with other countries. It also paved the way for social and political reforms, including the introduction of multiparty democracy in 1991."
