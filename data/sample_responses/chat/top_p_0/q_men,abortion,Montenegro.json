                "content": "It is important to note that opinions on abortion can vary among individuals, and it is not possible to generalize the views of an entire population. However, in Montenegro, a predominantly conservative society, there is a significant portion of men who hold traditional and religious beliefs, which often oppose abortion. These individuals may view abortion as morally wrong and believe in the sanctity of life from conception. However, it is also worth mentioning that there are men in Montenegro who support a woman's right to choose and believe in the importance of reproductive rights and autonomy. Overall, the views on abortion among men in Montenegro can be diverse, reflecting a range of personal, cultural, and religious perspectives."
