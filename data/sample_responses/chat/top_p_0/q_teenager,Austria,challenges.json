The education system in Austria is highly competitive, leading to high expectations and stress among teenagers to perform well academically. This pressure can contribute to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drug use, is also a concern among Austrian teenagers. Peer pressure plays a significant role in influencing their behavior and choices, including engaging in risky activities. Additionally, the influence of social media can impact teenagers' self-esteem, body image, and overall mental well-being."
