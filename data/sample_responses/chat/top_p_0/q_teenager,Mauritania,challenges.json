Many teenagers, especially those living in rural areas, struggle to attend school due to factors such as poverty, lack of infrastructure, and cultural norms that prioritize early marriage for girls. This hampers their ability to acquire necessary skills and knowledge for their future.\n\nAnother major challenge is the prevalence of child labor.
