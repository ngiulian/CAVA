                "content": "Most women in Estonia have a relatively progressive and open-minded attitude towards divorce. They view it as a viable option to end an unhappy or dysfunctional marriage, rather than staying in an unhealthy relationship. Women in Estonia prioritize their personal happiness and well-being, and they believe that divorce can provide them with the opportunity to start afresh and find a more fulfilling life. They also value their independence and autonomy, and divorce is seen as a means to assert their individuality and make decisions that are in their best interest. Additionally, women in Estonia tend to have a strong support system from family, friends, and society, which further encourages them to consider divorce as a legitimate choice."
