The education system in Panama often lacks resources and quality teachers, making it difficult for teenagers to receive a proper education. Additionally, poverty and inequality are prevalent issues, with many teenagers living in disadvantaged conditions and lacking basic necessities. Limited job opportunities further hinder their prospects for a better future. Moreover, some teenagers are exposed to drugs and violence, which can negatively impact their well-being and future prospects."
