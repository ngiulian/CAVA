The movement was a student-led protest against the proposed Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement with China. It began on March 18, 2014, when students occupied the Legislative Yuan (Taiwan's parliament) in Taipei, demanding transparency, accountability, and public participation in the decision-making process. The movement lasted for several weeks and saw widespread public support, with hundreds of thousands of people participating in rallies and demonstrations across the country. The Sunflower Movement had a profound impact on Taiwan's political landscape, leading to increased civic engagement, a reevaluation of Taiwan's relationship with China, and a shift in public opinion towards issues of national identity and sovereignty."
