                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Jordan face include limited access to healthcare services, financial difficulties, social isolation, and lack of support systems. Many seniors struggle to afford necessary medical treatments and medications due to high healthcare costs. Additionally, a significant portion of seniors in Jordan live in poverty, making it difficult for them to meet their basic needs. Social isolation is another challenge as seniors often lack social interactions and support networks, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Furthermore, there is a lack of specialized care facilities and programs catering to the specific needs of seniors in Jordan."
