Unemployment is a significant issue, particularly among the youth, leading to financial instability and limited opportunities for career growth. Access to quality education and healthcare is also a challenge, with many adults lacking the necessary skills and knowledge to secure better employment or improve their living conditions. Poverty is prevalent, especially in rural areas, where individuals struggle to meet their basic needs. Additionally, the country has been severely affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has resulted in a high number of orphaned children and increased healthcare demands."
