The country also struggles with a relatively low average wage, making it difficult for many adults to make ends meet. Additionally, there are issues with an aging population and inadequate healthcare services, which can pose challenges for adults in terms of accessing quality healthcare. Corruption and bureaucracy are also significant challenges, affecting various aspects of daily life and hindering economic growth. Finally, the lack of affordable housing and high living costs can make it challenging for adults to find suitable accommodation and maintain a decent standard of living."
