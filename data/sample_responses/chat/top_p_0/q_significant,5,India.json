On August 5, 2019, the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, which had granted it a significant degree of autonomy. This move led to the bifurcation of the state into two separate union territories, Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. The decision had far-reaching implications for the region, sparking both praise and criticism within India and internationally, and significantly altering the political landscape of Jammu and Kashmir."
