They consider divorce to be a shameful and dishonorable act that goes against their cultural and religious beliefs. Men generally believe that divorce brings disgrace to the family and community, and it is seen as a failure to maintain a stable and harmonious marriage. Consequently, they often discourage divorce and prioritize maintaining the sanctity of marriage."
