                "content": "Most men in Japan tend to have negative views towards divorce. They often perceive divorce as a failure and a source of shame, both personally and socially. Many men believe that divorce disrupts the traditional family structure and can have negative consequences for children. Additionally, there is a societal expectation for men to prioritize work and provide for their families, which can make divorce seem like a betrayal of these responsibilities. Consequently, men in Japan often feel pressured to stay in unhappy marriages, even if they are unhappy themselves."
