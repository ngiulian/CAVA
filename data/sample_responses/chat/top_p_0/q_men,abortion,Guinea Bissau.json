However, it is worth noting that Guinea Bissau is a predominantly Muslim country, and Islamic teachings generally consider abortion to be forbidden except in certain exceptional circumstances. Therefore, many men in Guinea Bissau may hold conservative views on abortion, aligning with religious beliefs. However, it is important to recognize that opinions on this matter can differ among individuals based on personal, cultural, and religious backgrounds."
