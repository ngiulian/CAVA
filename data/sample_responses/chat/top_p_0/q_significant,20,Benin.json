After nearly three decades of authoritarian rule under President Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou, Benin held presidential elections in March 2006. The incumbent president, K\u00e9r\u00e9kou, respected the constitution and stepped down, allowing for a peaceful transfer of power to the newly elected president, Boni Yayi. This event marked a significant milestone in Benin's democratic development and demonstrated the country's commitment to democratic principles."
