Many seniors struggle to afford medical treatment and medications due to the high cost of healthcare services. Poverty is a significant issue, with a large number of seniors living in extreme poverty and lacking basic necessities. Additionally, there is a lack of social support systems, such as pensions or social security, leaving many seniors financially vulnerable. Age discrimination is prevalent, leading to exclusion from employment opportunities and societal marginalization."
