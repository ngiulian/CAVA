The education system in India is highly competitive, leading to immense pressure on teenagers to excel academically. Additionally, societal expectations regarding career choices, marriage, and conformity can be overwhelming for teenagers, often limiting their freedom to pursue their passions and dreams. Limited career opportunities and a highly competitive job market further add to the challenges faced by teenagers. Mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression are also prevalent due to the aforementioned pressures. Moreover, social inequalities based on gender, caste, and economic background can hinder the growth and opportunities available to teenagers, creating additional challenges for them."
