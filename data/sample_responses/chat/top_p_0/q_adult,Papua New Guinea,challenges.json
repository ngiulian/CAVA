                "content": "Adults in Papua New Guinea face several significant challenges. One of the biggest challenges is poverty, with a large portion of the population living below the poverty line. Limited access to education and healthcare services is another major issue, particularly in rural areas. High rates of unemployment and underemployment also contribute to the economic struggles faced by adults. Additionally, gender inequality and violence against women are prevalent issues, hindering the progress and well-being of adult women. The country also grapples with high rates of HIV/AIDS and other health concerns, including malaria and tuberculosis. Infrastructure deficiencies, such as inadequate transportation and limited access to clean water and sanitation, further compound the challenges faced by adults in Papua New Guinea."
