Kuczynski, who took office in 2016, faced allegations of corruption and was impeached by the Peruvian Congress on charges of \"permanent moral incapacity.\" This event led to political instability and a series of protests across the country. Kuczynski's impeachment marked a significant moment in Peru's political landscape and highlighted the ongoing challenges of corruption and governance in the country."
