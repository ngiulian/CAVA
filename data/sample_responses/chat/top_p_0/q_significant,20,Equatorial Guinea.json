This discovery transformed the country's economy and made it one of the largest oil producers in Sub-Saharan Africa. The oil boom brought significant foreign investment and increased government revenue, leading to rapid economic growth and infrastructure development. However, the benefits of this oil wealth have not been evenly distributed, and the country continues to face challenges related to corruption, inequality, and human rights abuses."
