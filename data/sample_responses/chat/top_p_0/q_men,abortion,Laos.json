However, it is important to note that Laos is a predominantly Buddhist country, and Buddhism generally discourages the act of abortion. Many men in Laos may hold conservative views on abortion due to cultural and religious beliefs. However, it is crucial to recognize that individual perspectives can differ, and some men may have more liberal or nuanced opinions on the matter."
