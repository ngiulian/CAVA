                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Panama face include limited access to healthcare, financial insecurity, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford quality healthcare due to high medical costs and limited insurance coverage. Financial insecurity is a significant concern as pensions may not be sufficient to cover basic needs, leading to poverty among seniors. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and societal attitudes can hinder seniors' ability to find work or participate fully in society."
