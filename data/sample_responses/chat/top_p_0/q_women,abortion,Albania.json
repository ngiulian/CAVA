However, it is known that abortion is a highly debated and sensitive topic in the country. Albania has a complex history with abortion, as it was legalized during the communist era in the 1960s and 1970s, but then banned in the 1990s due to the influence of religious and conservative values.\n\nSome women in Albania may support the right to access safe and legal abortions, believing that it is a woman's choice and a matter of reproductive rights. They may argue that women should have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies and pregnancies, especially in cases of health risks, fetal abnormalities, or unwanted pregnancies.\n\nOn the other hand, there are women in Albania who oppose abortion due to religious, cultural, or personal beliefs. They may view it as morally wrong or against their traditional values, considering it as the termination of a potential life. These women may advocate for alternative options such as adoption or promoting contraception and family planning methods to prevent unwanted pregnancies.\n\nOverall, the opinions of women in Albania regarding abortion are diverse and influenced by various factors such as personal beliefs, religious values, cultural norms, and individual circumstances."
