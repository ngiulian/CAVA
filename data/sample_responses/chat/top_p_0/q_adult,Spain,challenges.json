The cost of living, including housing and healthcare, is also a significant challenge for many adults. Additionally, there are concerns about the quality of education and the need for continuous skill development to remain competitive in the job market. Political instability and corruption have also been ongoing challenges in Spain, affecting the overall trust in the government and institutions. Finally, the aging population and the strain it puts on the pension system and healthcare services pose additional challenges for adults in Spain."
