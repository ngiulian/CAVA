                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Guyana face include limited access to healthcare, financial insecurity, social isolation, and inadequate support systems. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, leading to health issues going untreated. Financial insecurity is a significant concern, as pensions and retirement benefits may not be sufficient to cover basic needs. Social isolation is prevalent among seniors, as they often lack opportunities for social engagement and may experience neglect or abandonment. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive support systems and services specifically tailored to the needs of seniors in Guyana."
