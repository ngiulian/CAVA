Hurricane Ivan was a Category 4 storm that caused widespread devastation across the island. It resulted in the loss of several lives, extensive damage to infrastructure, and significant economic impact. The hurricane caused severe flooding, landslides, and destruction of homes, leaving many Jamaicans displaced and in need of assistance. The impact of Hurricane Ivan was felt for years, and it highlighted the vulnerability of the island to natural disasters."
