The elections resulted in a change of government, with the opposition party, the People's National Movement (PNM), winning a majority of seats and returning to power. This marked the end of the United National Congress (UNC) government's term, led by Kamla Persad-Bissessar. The PNM's victory led to the re-election of Dr. Keith Rowley as the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago for a second consecutive term. The elections were closely watched as they determined the country's leadership and direction for the next five years."
