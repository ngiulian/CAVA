The Rogun Dam is a major hydroelectric power project located on the Vakhsh River, and it is considered to be one of the world's tallest dams. The completion of this project was a significant milestone for Tajikistan as it aims to become a major exporter of electricity in the region. The dam has the potential to provide a stable source of energy for the country and contribute to its economic development."
