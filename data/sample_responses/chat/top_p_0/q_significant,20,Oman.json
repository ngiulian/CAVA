Sultan Qaboos, who had ruled Oman for nearly 50 years, passed away, and his cousin, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, ascended to the throne. This transition marked a historic moment for Oman as it ensured stability and continuity in the country's leadership. Sultan Haitham has since implemented various reforms and initiatives to diversify the economy, promote social development, and enhance Oman's international relations."
