Many seniors struggle with low pensions and rising living costs, making it hard to meet their basic needs. Access to quality healthcare can be a challenge, especially in rural areas, leading to longer waiting times and limited resources. Social isolation is a significant concern, as seniors may lack social connections and support networks, leading to loneliness and mental health issues. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and society can hinder seniors' opportunities for work and participation in various activities."
