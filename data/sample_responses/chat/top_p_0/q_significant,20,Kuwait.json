This event, known as the Second Gulf War or the Iraq War, led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. The invasion had a profound impact on Kuwait, as it resulted in the liberation of the country from Iraqi occupation and the restoration of its sovereignty. The conflict also had broader regional and international implications, as it marked a significant chapter in the ongoing geopolitical dynamics of the Middle East."
