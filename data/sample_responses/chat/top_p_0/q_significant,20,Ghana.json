                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Ghana in the past 20 years is the discovery and production of oil in commercial quantities. In 2007, significant offshore oil reserves were discovered in the Tano Basin, leading to the start of oil production in 2010. This event has had a transformative impact on Ghana's economy, contributing to increased government revenue, foreign investment, and economic growth. The oil industry has created employment opportunities and stimulated various sectors, such as infrastructure development and services. However, it has also presented challenges in terms of managing resource wealth, ensuring transparency, and avoiding the \"resource curse\" phenomenon. Overall, the discovery of oil has been a significant event that has shaped Ghana's economy and development trajectory in the past two decades."
