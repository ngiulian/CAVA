                "content": "Most men in Ivory Coast hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is a last resort and should be avoided if possible. Men often perceive divorce as a failure and a source of shame, as it goes against traditional values and societal expectations of maintaining a stable and intact family unit. They prioritize the preservation of the family and the well-being of their children over personal happiness or individual desires. Men in Ivory Coast tend to view divorce as a disruption to social harmony and stability, and they often prefer to endure unhappy marriages rather than face the social consequences of divorce."
