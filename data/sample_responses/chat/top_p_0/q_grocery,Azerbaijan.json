Walking: If the weather is pleasant and you enjoy walking, you can simply walk to the grocery store. It will take you approximately 10-15 minutes to cover a distance of 1km on foot.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle or can rent one, cycling can be a convenient and quick way to reach the grocery store. It will take you around 3-5 minutes to cover the distance on a bike.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Depending on the availability of public transportation in your area, you can check if there are any buses or minibusses that pass by or near the grocery store. You can inquire about the nearest bus stop and take a bus to reach your destination.\n\n4. Taxi: Taxis are readily available in Azerbaijan, and you can easily find one to take you to the grocery store. It will be a quick and convenient option, but it may be slightly more expensive than other modes of transportation.\n\nConsider the options available to you based on your preferences, convenience, and the resources at your disposal."
