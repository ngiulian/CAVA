This agreement allowed Andorra to adopt the euro as its official currency and established a monetary union with the European Union. Prior to this, Andorra had used the French franc and Spanish peseta as its official currencies. The agreement not only facilitated economic integration with the EU but also brought about various benefits for Andorra, including increased financial stability, improved trade relations, and enhanced tourism opportunities."
