This conflict occurred between Georgia and Russia over the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The war resulted in the loss of Georgian control over these regions and had a significant impact on the political landscape of the country. It also strained Georgia's relations with Russia and had long-lasting consequences for the region's stability and security."
