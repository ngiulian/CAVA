                "content": "Seniors in Turkmenistan face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare, financial difficulties, social isolation, and lack of support systems. The healthcare system in Turkmenistan is often inadequate, with limited resources and long waiting times, making it difficult for seniors to receive proper medical care. Financial difficulties are also common among seniors, as many rely on meager pensions that are often insufficient to cover their basic needs. This leads to a higher risk of poverty and difficulty in affording healthcare and other essential expenses. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack opportunities for social interaction and engagement, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Additionally, the lack of support systems, such as community centers or programs specifically catering to seniors, further exacerbates these challenges."
