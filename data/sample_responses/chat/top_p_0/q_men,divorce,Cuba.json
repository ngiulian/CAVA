Many men believe that divorce is a sign of weakness and a lack of commitment to the marriage. They may also feel societal pressure to maintain a stable and intact family unit. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, especially among younger generations, as they prioritize personal happiness and individual fulfillment over societal expectations."
