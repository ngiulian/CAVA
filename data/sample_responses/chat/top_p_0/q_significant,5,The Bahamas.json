It was the strongest hurricane on record to hit the region, causing widespread devastation and loss of life. The storm primarily impacted the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama, resulting in the destruction of homes, infrastructure, and natural habitats. The aftermath of Hurricane Dorian led to a massive humanitarian and recovery effort, with international assistance pouring in to support the affected communities."
