                "content": "Some of the biggest challenges adults in Tonga face include limited job opportunities, low wages, and high cost of living. The country's economy heavily relies on agriculture and fishing, leading to a lack of diverse employment options. This, coupled with a growing population, makes it difficult for adults to find stable and well-paying jobs. Additionally, the cost of living in Tonga is relatively high, making it challenging for adults to meet their basic needs and provide for their families. Limited access to healthcare and education, especially in rural areas, is another significant challenge faced by adults in Tonga."
