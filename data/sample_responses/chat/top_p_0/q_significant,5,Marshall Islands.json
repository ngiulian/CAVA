The Marshall Islands, being a low-lying island nation, is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels and extreme weather events. The signing of the Paris Agreement was a crucial moment for the country as it demonstrated its commitment to addressing climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Marshall Islands played a significant role in advocating for ambitious climate action and highlighting the urgent need for global cooperation to combat climate change."
