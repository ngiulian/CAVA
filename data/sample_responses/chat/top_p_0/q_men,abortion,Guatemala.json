They believe that abortion is morally wrong and goes against their religious and cultural values. Many men in Guatemala consider abortion to be a sin and believe that life begins at conception, making it unacceptable to terminate a pregnancy. These beliefs are often influenced by the strong influence of the Catholic Church in the country."
