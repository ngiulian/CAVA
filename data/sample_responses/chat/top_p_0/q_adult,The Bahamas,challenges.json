The country heavily relies on tourism, which makes it vulnerable to economic downturns and natural disasters. Additionally, there are issues related to income inequality, with a significant wealth gap between the rich and the poor. Access to affordable healthcare and education is also a challenge for many adults, particularly those living in remote areas. Crime rates, including violent crimes and drug-related offenses, pose a significant challenge to the safety and security of adults in The Bahamas."
