The healthcare system may not adequately address their specific needs, leading to difficulties in accessing quality medical care. Financially, some seniors may struggle due to limited retirement benefits or insufficient savings, making it challenging to cover their expenses. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may feel lonely or disconnected from their families and communities. Additionally, finding suitable housing options that cater to their needs and ensuring accessible transportation can be problematic for seniors in Kuwait."
