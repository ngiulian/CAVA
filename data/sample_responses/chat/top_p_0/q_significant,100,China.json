This event marked the end of a long period of civil war and the beginning of communist rule under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. The establishment of the PRC had a profound impact on China's political, social, and economic landscape, leading to significant changes in the country's governance, land reforms, industrialization, and foreign policy. It also marked the beginning of China's transformation into a major global power."
