This event marked the end of Turkmenistan's 70-year incorporation into the Soviet Union and the establishment of the country as an independent nation. It led to the formation of a new government and the adoption of a new constitution, allowing Turkmenistan to shape its own political, economic, and social systems. This declaration of independence had a profound impact on the country's trajectory, shaping its identity, governance, and relationships with other nations."
