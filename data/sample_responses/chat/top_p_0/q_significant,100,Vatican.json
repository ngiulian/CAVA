He became the first non-Italian pope in 455 years and the first Polish pope in history. His papacy lasted for 26 years, making him one of the longest-serving popes in history. Pope John Paul II played a crucial role in shaping the modern Catholic Church, advocating for human rights, promoting interfaith dialogue, and playing a significant role in the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. His influence and impact on the Vatican and the world were profound, making his election a significant event in Vatican history."
