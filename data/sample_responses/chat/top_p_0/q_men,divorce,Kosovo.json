They generally view divorce as a failure and a social stigma, believing that it reflects poorly on their masculinity and ability to maintain a stable family. Men often prioritize the preservation of their marriage and family unity, considering divorce as a last resort. They may feel societal pressure to stay in unhappy marriages, fearing judgment from their community and potential damage to their reputation."
