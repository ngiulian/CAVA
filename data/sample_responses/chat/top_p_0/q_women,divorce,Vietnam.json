                "content": "Most women in Vietnam have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women view divorce as a way to escape unhappy or abusive marriages and seek personal freedom, others consider it a last resort due to societal and cultural pressures. Many women prioritize maintaining the family unit and preserving their children's well-being, which can make them hesitant to pursue divorce. Additionally, financial concerns and the fear of social stigma often discourage women from seeking divorce. However, with changing attitudes and increasing awareness of women's rights, some women in Vietnam are becoming more open to the idea of divorce as a means to improve their lives and pursue happiness."
