The ongoing political division on the island creates a challenging environment for teenagers, as it affects their daily lives and future prospects. The educational system in Northern Cyprus is not recognized internationally, limiting their options for higher education and career opportunities. Additionally, teenagers often face social pressures related to peer groups, relationships, and societal expectations. Limited access to resources and opportunities, such as cultural events, extracurricular activities, and employment prospects, further adds to the challenges faced by teenagers in Northern Cyprus."
