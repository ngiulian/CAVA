                "content": "Seniors in Guinea face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare, poverty, social isolation, and inadequate support systems. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, leading to untreated health conditions. Poverty is prevalent among seniors, as they often lack sufficient retirement benefits or pensions, making it difficult to meet their basic needs. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, leading to loneliness and mental health issues. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive support systems and programs specifically designed for seniors, which further exacerbates their challenges."
