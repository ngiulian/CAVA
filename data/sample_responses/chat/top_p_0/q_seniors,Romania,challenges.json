                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Romania face include financial difficulties, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with low pensions that are insufficient to cover their basic needs, leading to poverty and difficulty in affording healthcare and medication. The healthcare system often lacks adequate resources and specialized services for the elderly, resulting in limited access to quality healthcare. Social isolation is another significant challenge as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement, leading to loneliness and mental health issues. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and society can hinder seniors' ability to find work or participate fully in community life."
