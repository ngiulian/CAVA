                "content": "Most women in Cyprus have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women view divorce as a necessary step to escape an unhappy or abusive marriage, others believe in preserving the sanctity of marriage and see divorce as a last resort. Many women also consider the impact of divorce on their children and the social stigma associated with it. Overall, the attitudes towards divorce among women in Cyprus vary depending on personal experiences, cultural and religious beliefs, and societal norms."
