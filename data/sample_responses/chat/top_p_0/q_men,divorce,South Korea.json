                "content": "Most men in South Korea have traditionally held negative views towards divorce. They often perceive divorce as a social stigma and a failure in maintaining a stable family unit. Men tend to prioritize societal expectations and cultural norms that emphasize the importance of maintaining a harmonious marriage. Divorce is often seen as a disruption to family values and can be viewed as a personal and public embarrassment. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, especially among younger generations, as they prioritize individual happiness and personal fulfillment over societal expectations."
