This event marked a major turning point in the country's political landscape.\n\nIn 2018, Madagascar faced a political crisis when the Constitutional Court ordered the then-president, Hery Rajaonarimampianina, to form a new government. This decision led to widespread protests and political instability. The crisis eventually resulted in the resignation of the prime minister and the appointment of a new consensus prime minister, Christian Ntsay, to lead a transitional government.\n\nAmidst this political turmoil, Madagascar held its presidential election in late 2018. The election saw a high voter turnout and was closely contested between two main candidates, Andry Rajoelina and Marc Ravalomanana, both former presidents of the country. After a run-off election, Andry Rajoelina emerged as the winner and was inaugurated as the new president in January 2019.\n\nThis event was significant as it marked a peaceful transition of power and the return of Andry Rajoelina to the presidency. It also highlighted the democratic process in Madagascar and the importance of political stability for the country's development."
