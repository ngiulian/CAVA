                "content": "It is challenging to provide an accurate summary of what most women in Western Sahara think of abortion as there is limited available data specifically addressing this topic. Western Sahara is a disputed territory, and its population is primarily composed of Sahrawi people, who have been affected by ongoing conflict and displacement. Additionally, cultural and religious beliefs may influence individual opinions on abortion. Therefore, it is important to recognize that women's perspectives on abortion in Western Sahara can vary significantly."
