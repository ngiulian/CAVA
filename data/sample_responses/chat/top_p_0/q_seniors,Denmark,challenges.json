Social isolation is a significant issue as seniors may experience loneliness and lack of social interaction, especially if they live alone or have limited mobility. Limited access to healthcare services can be a challenge, particularly in rural areas, where seniors may face long waiting times or difficulties in accessing specialized care. Financial insecurity can arise due to pension limitations or high costs of living, leading to difficulties in meeting basic needs or affording healthcare. Ageism, or discrimination based on age, can also be a challenge as seniors may face stereotypes, prejudice, or limited opportunities for employment or social participation."
