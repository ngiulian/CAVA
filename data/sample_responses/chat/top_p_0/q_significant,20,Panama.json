                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Panama in the past 20 years is the expansion of the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal is a vital waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and its expansion was a major engineering feat. Completed in 2016, the expansion involved the construction of a new set of locks, allowing larger ships to pass through the canal. This expansion has had a significant impact on global trade, increasing the canal's capacity and efficiency, and positioning Panama as a key player in international maritime commerce."
