This period, known as the \"Dirty War,\" was characterized by widespread human rights abuses, including forced disappearances, torture, and killings of thousands of people. The military junta, led by General Jorge Rafael Videla, aimed to eliminate leftist opposition and maintain control over the country. The impact of this event on Argentine society and politics has been profound, with ongoing efforts to seek justice, remember the victims, and address the legacy of the dictatorship."
