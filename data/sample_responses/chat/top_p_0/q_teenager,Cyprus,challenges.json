The education system in Cyprus is highly competitive, leading to stress and anxiety among teenagers to perform well academically. Additionally, the limited job market and high youth unemployment rates make it difficult for teenagers to find employment opportunities. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drug use, is a concern among some teenagers in Cyprus. Mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders are also prevalent, often exacerbated by academic and social pressures. Lastly, teenagers in Cyprus may face social pressures related to peer acceptance, body image, and social media, which can impact their self-esteem and overall well-being."
