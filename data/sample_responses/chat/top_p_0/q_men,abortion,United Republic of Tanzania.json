                "content": "Most men in the United Republic of Tanzania hold conservative views on abortion. They generally oppose the practice and believe it should be illegal, except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. Men often perceive abortion as morally wrong and against their cultural and religious beliefs. They prioritize the protection of unborn life and advocate for alternative options such as adoption or raising the child. However, it is important to note that opinions on abortion can vary among individuals, and there may be some men who hold more liberal views on the matter."
