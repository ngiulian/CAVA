                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Ukraine face include inadequate healthcare services, limited access to social support, financial difficulties, and social isolation. The healthcare system in Ukraine often lacks resources and infrastructure, leading to difficulties in accessing quality medical care for seniors. Additionally, the pension system is often insufficient, leaving many seniors struggling to meet their basic needs. Social support services, such as home care or assisted living facilities, are limited, making it challenging for seniors to receive the necessary assistance. Moreover, social isolation is a significant issue, as many seniors lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, leading to loneliness and mental health issues."
