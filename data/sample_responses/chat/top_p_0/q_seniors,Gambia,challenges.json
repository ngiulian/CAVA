                "content": "Seniors in Gambia face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare and medical services. Many seniors struggle with chronic illnesses and lack the necessary resources for proper treatment. Additionally, poverty is a significant issue, with a large portion of seniors living in poverty and lacking financial security. This often leads to inadequate nutrition and living conditions. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for engagement. Furthermore, there is a lack of specialized care facilities for seniors, making it difficult for them to receive appropriate care and support."
