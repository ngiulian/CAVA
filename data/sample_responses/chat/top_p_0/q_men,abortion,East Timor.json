They believe that abortion is morally wrong and goes against their cultural and religious beliefs. Men in East Timor often prioritize the sanctity of life and the importance of family values, leading them to view abortion as a violation of these principles. They typically support laws and policies that restrict or prohibit abortion, considering it as a form of taking a life and a threat to the traditional family structure."
