                "content": "Most women in Kuwait have mixed opinions about divorce. Some women view divorce as a last resort and believe in working through marital issues to maintain the family unit. They prioritize stability and the well-being of their children, often considering divorce as a failure or a social stigma. These women may be more inclined to seek counseling or mediation to resolve conflicts within their marriage.\n\nHowever, there is also a growing number of women in Kuwait who are becoming more independent and empowered, leading to a shift in attitudes towards divorce. These women prioritize their own happiness, personal growth, and freedom, and are more willing to consider divorce if their marriage becomes unhappy or unfulfilling. They believe in the importance of self-fulfillment and may be more open to exploring their options, including divorce, to improve their quality of life.\n\nIt is important to note that attitudes towards divorce can vary among individuals, and cultural, religious, and personal factors play a significant role in shaping these opinions."
