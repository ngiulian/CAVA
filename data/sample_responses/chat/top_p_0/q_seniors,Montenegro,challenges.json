Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare and face long waiting times for medical treatments. Financially, they often have inadequate pensions and struggle to cover their basic needs. Social isolation is a significant issue, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Additionally, age discrimination can lead to limited employment opportunities and exclusion from certain activities or services."
