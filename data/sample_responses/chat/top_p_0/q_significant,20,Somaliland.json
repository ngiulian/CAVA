This election marked the first time in over two decades that Somaliland held a peaceful and democratic presidential election. The incumbent president, Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud Silanyo, stepped down after serving his term, and the election resulted in the peaceful transfer of power to the newly elected president, Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud \"Silanyo.\" This event showcased Somaliland's commitment to democracy and stability, further solidifying its claim for international recognition as an independent state."
