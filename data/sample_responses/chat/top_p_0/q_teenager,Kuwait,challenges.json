Social pressures can arise from peer groups, where conformity and fitting in become important, leading to issues like bullying, body image concerns, and substance abuse. Academic stress is another challenge, as the education system in Kuwait is highly competitive, and students face immense pressure to excel academically. Limited opportunities for personal growth can be attributed to a lack of extracurricular activities and limited access to resources for pursuing hobbies or interests. Additionally, cultural restrictions, such as conservative societal norms and gender segregation, can limit teenagers' freedom of expression and exploration."
