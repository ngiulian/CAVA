                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Ukraine in the past 100 years is the Ukrainian Revolution of 2014, also known as the Euromaidan Revolution or the Revolution of Dignity. It was a series of protests and demonstrations that began in late 2013 and continued into 2014, triggered by the Ukrainian government's decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the European Union. The protests grew in size and intensity, demanding political and economic reforms, an end to corruption, and closer ties with Europe.\n\nThe revolution culminated in February 2014 when violent clashes between protesters and security forces resulted in the deaths of over 100 people. This led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych and the formation of a new government. The events of the revolution also sparked the Russian annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine, which has had significant geopolitical implications for the region and strained relations between Ukraine and Russia. The Ukrainian Revolution of 2014 marked a turning point in the country's history, shaping its political landscape and aspirations for greater democracy and European integration."
