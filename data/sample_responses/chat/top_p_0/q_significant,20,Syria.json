The conflict started as a peaceful uprising against the government of President Bashar al-Assad but quickly escalated into a full-scale civil war. The war has resulted in immense human suffering, with hundreds of thousands of people killed, millions displaced, and widespread destruction of infrastructure and cities. It has also drawn in various regional and international actors, exacerbating the complexity of the conflict. The Syrian Civil War has had far-reaching consequences, including the rise of extremist groups, the displacement of millions of refugees, and significant geopolitical shifts in the region."
