However, it can be said that attitudes towards divorce have evolved over time. Many women in the UK view divorce as a viable option to end an unhappy or unhealthy marriage. They believe that individuals have the right to pursue personal happiness and fulfillment, even if it means ending a marriage. Divorce is generally seen as a way to escape abusive relationships, irreconcilable differences, or when the marriage is no longer fulfilling. However, it is important to note that there are also women who may hold more traditional views and see divorce as a last resort, preferring to work on their marriages or prioritize family stability. Overall, women's opinions on divorce in the UK are diverse and influenced by personal experiences, cultural backgrounds, and societal norms."
