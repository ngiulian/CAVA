However, it is known that Japan has a relatively liberal stance on abortion compared to some other countries. Abortion is legal and accessible in Japan, and it is generally accepted as a personal choice for women. Many women in Japan believe that a woman should have the right to decide whether to continue a pregnancy based on her own circumstances, including factors such as her health, financial situation, and personal beliefs. However, like in any society, there are diverse opinions on this topic, and some individuals may hold different views based on their cultural, religious, or personal beliefs."
