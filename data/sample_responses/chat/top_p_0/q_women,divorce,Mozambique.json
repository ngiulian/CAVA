                "content": "Most women in Mozambique have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a last resort and believe that marriage should be a lifelong commitment. Women often prioritize maintaining the stability of their families and the well-being of their children over personal happiness or individual desires. Divorce is seen as a social stigma and can lead to judgment and exclusion from the community. Additionally, women may face economic hardships and social disadvantages after divorce, making them hesitant to pursue it. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, especially among younger generations who are more influenced by modern ideas and values."
