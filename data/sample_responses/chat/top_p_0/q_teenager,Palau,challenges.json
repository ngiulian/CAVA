The small size and remote location of Palau limit the availability of quality education, leading to limited options for higher education and career prospects. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drug use, is a prevalent issue among teenagers, which can lead to various health and social problems. Peer pressure is another challenge, as teenagers may feel compelled to conform to certain behaviors or engage in risky activities to fit in with their peers. Additionally, mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and suicide are growing concerns, with limited access to mental health services exacerbating the problem."
