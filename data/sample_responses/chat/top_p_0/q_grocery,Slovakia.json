Walking: If the weather is pleasant and you have the time, walking can be a convenient and healthy option.

Slovakia has a well-developed cycling infrastructure, and many cities have dedicated bike lanes or paths. Make sure to follow traffic rules and wear a helmet for safety.\n\n3. Public transportation: Depending on the location and availability, you can use public transportation such as buses or trams to reach the grocery store.

Taxi or rideshare: If you prefer a more comfortable and direct option, you can call a taxi or use a ridesharing app to get to the grocery store.
