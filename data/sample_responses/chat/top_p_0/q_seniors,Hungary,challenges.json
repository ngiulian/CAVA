Many seniors struggle with low pensions and rising living costs, making it difficult to afford basic necessities. Access to quality healthcare can be limited, with long waiting times and inadequate services in some areas. Social isolation is a common issue, as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement. Age discrimination can also be a challenge, with seniors facing stereotypes and barriers in employment and society."
