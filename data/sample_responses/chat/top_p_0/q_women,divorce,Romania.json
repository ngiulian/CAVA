                "content": "It is important to note that opinions on divorce can vary among individuals, and it is not possible to generalize the views of all women in Romania. However, in Romanian society, divorce is generally considered a significant and life-altering decision. Many women may view divorce as a last resort, preferring to work on their marriages and maintain the family unit. Traditional values and societal expectations often place a strong emphasis on marriage and family, which can influence women's perspectives on divorce. However, with changing times and increased empowerment, some women may also recognize the importance of personal happiness and may be more open to the idea of divorce if their marriage is unhappy or abusive. Ultimately, individual beliefs and experiences shape women's attitudes towards divorce in Romania."
