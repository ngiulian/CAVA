However, it can be said that divorce is generally seen as a personal decision that women have the right to make if they are unhappy in their marriage. Many women in Australia believe that divorce can be a means to escape an unhealthy or abusive relationship and seek a better future for themselves and their children. Additionally, there is a growing acceptance of divorce as a normal part of life, and women are often encouraged to prioritize their own happiness and well-being. However, it is important to note that attitudes towards divorce can differ based on cultural, religious, and personal beliefs, and not all women may share the same perspective."
