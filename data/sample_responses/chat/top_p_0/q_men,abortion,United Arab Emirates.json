However, it is important to note that the UAE follows Islamic law, which generally considers abortion to be prohibited except in certain circumstances. Islamic teachings prioritize the preservation of life, and abortion is typically only allowed if the mother's life is at risk or if the fetus has severe abnormalities. \n\nIn the UAE, societal attitudes towards abortion tend to align with religious beliefs, and many men may hold conservative views on the matter. They may generally oppose abortion except in cases where it is deemed necessary for medical reasons. However, it is important to recognize that opinions can differ among individuals, and some men in the UAE may have more liberal or nuanced perspectives on abortion based on personal experiences, education, or cultural influences."
