                "content": "Most men in Georgia have a negative perception of divorce. They often view it as a failure and a source of shame, believing that it reflects poorly on their ability to maintain a successful marriage. Additionally, many men in Georgia hold traditional values that prioritize the preservation of the family unit and may perceive divorce as a threat to their role as a provider and protector. Consequently, they may be reluctant to consider or accept divorce as an option, preferring to endure unhappy marriages rather than face the social stigma associated with divorce."
