Compaor\u00e9 had been in power for 27 years and was attempting to amend the constitution to extend his rule. This move sparked widespread protests and demonstrations across the country, eventually culminating in a mass uprising. The protesters occupied the streets of the capital, Ouagadougou, and stormed the parliament building, forcing Compaor\u00e9 to resign and flee the country. This event marked a significant turning point in Burkina Faso's political landscape and opened the door for a transition towards democracy."
