The Japanese-owned bulk carrier ran aground on a coral reef off the southeast coast of Mauritius, causing a major environmental disaster. The ship leaked over 1,000 tons of oil into the pristine waters, leading to widespread damage to the marine ecosystem, coral reefs, and mangrove forests. The incident had a significant impact on the local economy, tourism, and the livelihoods of coastal communities. It also highlighted the need for improved maritime safety and environmental protection measures in the region."
