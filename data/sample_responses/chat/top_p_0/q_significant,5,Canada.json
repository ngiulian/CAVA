On October 17, 2018, Canada became the second country in the world, after Uruguay, to legalize the recreational use of marijuana nationwide. This event had a significant impact on various aspects of Canadian society, including legal, social, economic, and health-related factors. The legalization of cannabis brought about changes in legislation, business opportunities, public perception, and discussions surrounding drug policy."
