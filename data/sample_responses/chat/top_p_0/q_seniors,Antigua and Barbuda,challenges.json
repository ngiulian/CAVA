Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare and may face difficulties accessing necessary medications and treatments. Financial insecurity is a significant concern, as some seniors may not have sufficient retirement savings or pensions to meet their basic needs. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Additionally, age discrimination can lead to limited employment opportunities and unequal treatment in various aspects of life."
