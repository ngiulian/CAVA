Men often believe that divorce brings shame and stigma to both parties involved, particularly the woman. They tend to prioritize the preservation of the family unit and may perceive divorce as a sign of weakness or inability to resolve conflicts. Additionally, some men may hold religious or cultural beliefs that discourage divorce, further influencing their negative attitudes towards it."
