The ongoing conflict in the country has resulted in displacement, loss of family members, and disrupted education, leaving many teenagers without proper support systems. Poverty and lack of infrastructure further hinder their access to basic necessities and opportunities for a better future. Additionally, the prevalence of armed groups increases the risk of forced recruitment, child labor, and exploitation, posing significant threats to their safety and well-being."
