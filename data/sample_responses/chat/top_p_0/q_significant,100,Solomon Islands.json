This conflict arose between the indigenous Guadalcanal people and migrants from the neighboring island of Malaita. It was primarily driven by land disputes, economic grievances, and political tensions. The conflict resulted in widespread violence, displacement of people, and significant damage to infrastructure and the economy. It also led to the intervention of regional peacekeeping forces, including Australia and New Zealand, to restore peace and stability in the country. The Tensions had a profound impact on the social, political, and economic landscape of the Solomon Islands, and its effects are still felt today."
