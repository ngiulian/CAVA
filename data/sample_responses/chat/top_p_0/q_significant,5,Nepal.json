This earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.8, caused widespread destruction, resulting in the loss of over 9,000 lives, injuring more than 22,000 people, and displacing millions from their homes. It also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including heritage sites like the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Kathmandu Durbar Square and Bhaktapur Durbar Square. The earthquake had a profound impact on Nepal's economy, society, and overall development, requiring extensive efforts for rescue, relief, and reconstruction."
