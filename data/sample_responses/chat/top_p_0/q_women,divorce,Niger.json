                "content": "Most women in Niger have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a last resort and believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment. Divorce is often seen as a failure and brings social stigma to women, affecting their reputation and social standing. Women in Niger prioritize maintaining the family unit and often endure difficult marriages for the sake of their children and societal expectations. However, attitudes towards divorce may vary among individuals based on their personal experiences and circumstances."
