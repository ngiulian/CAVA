Another challenge is the high cost of living, particularly in urban areas, which can make it difficult for adults to afford housing, education, and healthcare. Additionally, there are concerns about the quality and accessibility of healthcare services, as well as the sustainability of the pension system. Finally, there is a need for continuous upskilling and retraining to adapt to the changing job market and technological advancements."
