                "content": "Most men in East Timor hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is socially unacceptable and goes against traditional values and cultural norms. Men often perceive divorce as a failure of the husband to fulfill his responsibilities as a provider and protector of the family. They prioritize maintaining the unity and stability of the family unit, considering divorce as a disruption to this ideal. Additionally, religious beliefs, particularly the influence of Catholicism, play a significant role in shaping their negative attitudes towards divorce."
