Due to ongoing conflicts and instability, many teenagers struggle to receive a quality education, with a significant gender disparity in enrollment rates. Girls often face cultural barriers and discrimination, limiting their educational opportunities. Insecurity and violence pose a constant threat, with the presence of armed groups and the risk of bombings or attacks. Additionally, economic hardships, poverty, and lack of job opportunities further hinder teenagers' prospects for a better future."
