                "content": "Seniors in Macedonia face several challenges, including financial difficulties, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions, making it difficult for them to meet their basic needs and afford healthcare expenses. Additionally, the healthcare system may not adequately cater to the specific needs of seniors, leading to limited access to quality medical services. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors often lack social support networks and may feel lonely or neglected. Lastly, age discrimination can hinder seniors' opportunities for employment, social participation, and access to various services, further exacerbating their challenges."
