Bingu wa Mutharika, who had been in power since 2004, passed away suddenly in April 2012. This event triggered a constitutional crisis as his brother, Peter Mutharika, who was the foreign minister at the time, was initially prevented from assuming the presidency by some members of the government.\n\nHowever, the crisis was resolved peacefully, and Joyce Banda, the vice president, was sworn in as the country's first female president. This transition of power demonstrated the strength of Malawi's democratic institutions and set an important precedent for peaceful political transitions in the country. It also marked a significant moment for gender equality in Malawi, as Joyce Banda became a prominent female leader in Africa."
