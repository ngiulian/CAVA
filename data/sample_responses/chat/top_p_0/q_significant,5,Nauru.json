Under this agreement, Nauru became one of the offshore processing centers for asylum seekers attempting to reach Australia by boat. This agreement had a significant impact on Nauru's economy and social fabric, as the country experienced an influx of asylum seekers and the establishment of detention centers. The RPA has been a subject of controversy and criticism, with concerns raised about the treatment of asylum seekers and their living conditions on the island."
