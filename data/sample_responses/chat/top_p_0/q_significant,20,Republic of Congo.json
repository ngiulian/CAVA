This peace agreement ended the civil war that had been ongoing since 1997, which had resulted in significant loss of life and displacement of people. The accord brought about a ceasefire and established a power-sharing government, aiming to restore stability and promote national reconciliation. This event marked a crucial step towards peace and the beginning of a process of rebuilding and development in the country."
