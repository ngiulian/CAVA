However, it is worth noting that attitudes towards divorce have evolved over time, and many men in Canada now view divorce as a legitimate option for couples who are unhappy or incompatible. Some men may see divorce as an opportunity for personal growth and a chance to find happiness outside of a troubled marriage. However, it is important to recognize that there are diverse perspectives on divorce, and individual opinions can differ significantly based on personal experiences, cultural backgrounds, and values."
