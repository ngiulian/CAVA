                "content": "Most women in Ukraine have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women view divorce as a last resort and believe in working through marital issues, others see it as a way to escape unhappy or abusive relationships. The perception of divorce is influenced by cultural and societal factors, including traditional gender roles and the importance of family values. Many women prioritize the well-being of their children and strive to maintain a stable family environment, which can make them hesitant to pursue divorce. However, there is also a growing trend of women asserting their independence and seeking divorce to pursue personal happiness and freedom. Overall, the attitudes towards divorce among women in Ukraine vary, reflecting a complex interplay of cultural, social, and individual factors."
