                "content": "Most men in Ethiopia hold negative views towards divorce. They generally consider divorce as a last resort and believe that it should be avoided if possible. Men often perceive divorce as a failure of the husband's ability to maintain a stable and harmonious marriage. They prioritize the preservation of the family unit and the social stigma associated with divorce. Men in Ethiopia tend to value traditional gender roles and may view divorce as a threat to their authority and societal expectations. However, it is important to note that attitudes towards divorce can vary among individuals and across different regions within Ethiopia."
