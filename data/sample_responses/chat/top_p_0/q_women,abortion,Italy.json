However, it is generally observed that a significant portion of women in Italy support the right to access safe and legal abortion. Many women believe that a woman should have the autonomy to make decisions about her own body and reproductive health. However, there are also women who hold conservative views and oppose abortion, often due to religious or moral beliefs. Overall, the topic of abortion remains a subject of ongoing debate and discussion among women in Italy."
