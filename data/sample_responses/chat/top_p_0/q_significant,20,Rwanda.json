                "content": "The most significant event that happened in Rwanda in the past 20 years is the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The genocide occurred between April and July 1994, resulting in the mass killing of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. It was a brutal ethnic conflict between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority, fueled by long-standing tensions and political unrest. The genocide had a profound impact on Rwanda, leading to widespread devastation, displacement, and trauma. It also had significant repercussions for the international community, prompting discussions on humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to protect. Since then, Rwanda has made remarkable progress in rebuilding and reconciliation efforts, but the genocide remains a defining event in the country's recent history."
