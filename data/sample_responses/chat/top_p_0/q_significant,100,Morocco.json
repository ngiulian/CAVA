Morocco gained its independence on March 2, 1956, after years of resistance and negotiations. This event marked a turning point in the country's history, leading to the establishment of the modern Moroccan state. It allowed Morocco to regain its sovereignty, establish a constitutional monarchy, and embark on a path of political, social, and economic development."
