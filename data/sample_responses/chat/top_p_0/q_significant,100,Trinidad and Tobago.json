On August 31, 1962, Trinidad and Tobago gained independence and became a sovereign nation. This event marked a significant milestone in the country's history, as it allowed for self-governance and the development of its own political, social, and economic systems. Independence Day is now celebrated annually in Trinidad and Tobago to commemorate this historic event."
