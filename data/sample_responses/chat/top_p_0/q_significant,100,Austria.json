This event marked the end of Austria's independence and led to its integration into Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. The Anschluss had far-reaching consequences for Austria, including the persecution and displacement of Jewish citizens, the suppression of political opposition, and the involvement of Austrians in World War II. It remains a significant event in Austrian history and continues to shape the country's collective memory."
