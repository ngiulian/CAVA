On December 26, 2004, a massive undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra triggered a series of devastating tsunamis that affected several countries in the region, including the Maldives. The tsunami caused widespread destruction, with waves reaching up to 30 feet high, resulting in the loss of lives, displacement of people, and extensive damage to infrastructure and the environment. The Maldives, being a low-lying island nation, was particularly vulnerable to the tsunami's impact. This event had a profound and lasting impact on the country, leading to significant efforts in disaster preparedness, infrastructure development, and environmental conservation."
