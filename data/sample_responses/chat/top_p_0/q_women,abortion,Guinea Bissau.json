However, it is important to note that Guinea Bissau is a predominantly Muslim country where religious and cultural beliefs often influence attitudes towards abortion. Islam generally considers abortion to be forbidden, except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. Therefore, many women in Guinea Bissau may hold conservative views on abortion and consider it morally wrong. However, it is essential to recognize that individual opinions may differ, and some women may support the right to access safe and legal abortion in certain circumstances."
