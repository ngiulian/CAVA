Incumbent President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who had been in power since 1997, won a controversial fourth term in office. The election was marred by allegations of fraud and irregularities, leading to protests and clashes between security forces and opposition supporters. This event had a significant impact on the political landscape of the country and raised concerns about democratic processes and governance in the Republic of Congo."
