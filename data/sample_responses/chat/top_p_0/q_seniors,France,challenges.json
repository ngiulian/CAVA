Many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions and rising living costs, making it difficult to maintain a decent standard of living. Access to quality healthcare can be a challenge, especially for those living in rural areas. Social isolation is another significant issue, as seniors may lack social connections and face loneliness. Additionally, age discrimination can limit employment opportunities and hinder seniors' ability to actively participate in society."
