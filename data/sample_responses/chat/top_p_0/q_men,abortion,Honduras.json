They believe that abortion is morally wrong and goes against their religious and cultural values. Many men in Honduras consider abortion to be a violation of the sanctity of life and believe that it should only be allowed in cases where the mother's life is at risk. They often support strict laws and regulations that restrict access to abortion services in the country."
