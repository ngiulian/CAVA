                "content": "Most men in Burundi hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is a shameful and unacceptable act that goes against cultural and religious values. Men often perceive divorce as a failure of the husband to fulfill his responsibilities and maintain a stable family. They consider divorce as a disruption to social harmony and a threat to the well-being of children. Consequently, men in Burundi tend to discourage divorce and prioritize maintaining marital stability and unity."
