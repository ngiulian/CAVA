The Panama Canal is a vital waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and its control and operation were under the United States from its completion in 1914. However, on December 31, 1999, the canal was officially handed over to Panama, marking the end of nearly a century of U.S. control. This event symbolized Panama's sovereignty and control over its own strategic asset, leading to a significant shift in the country's political and economic landscape."
