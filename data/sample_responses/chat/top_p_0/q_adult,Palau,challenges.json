Additionally, the country's heavy reliance on tourism and the vulnerability of its economy to external factors pose challenges for adults seeking stable employment. The limited availability of higher education and professional development opportunities also hinders career growth and advancement. Furthermore, the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels and natural disasters, pose significant challenges to the livelihoods and well-being of adults in Palau."
