However, it is worth noting that Comoros is a predominantly Muslim country, and Islam generally considers abortion to be forbidden except in certain circumstances. Therefore, many men in Comoros may hold conservative views on abortion, aligning with religious teachings. However, it is important to recognize that opinions on this matter can differ among individuals, and there may be some who hold more liberal or nuanced perspectives."
