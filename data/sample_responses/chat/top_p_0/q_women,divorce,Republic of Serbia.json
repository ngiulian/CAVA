Some women view divorce as a necessary step to escape an unhappy or abusive marriage, seeking personal freedom and a chance for a better life. They believe that divorce can provide them with opportunities for personal growth, self-realization, and the chance to find a more compatible partner. These women often prioritize their own happiness and well-being over societal expectations or traditional values.\n\nHowever, there are also women who hold more conservative views on divorce. They may perceive divorce as a failure, a disruption of family values, and a source of social stigma. These women may prioritize maintaining the family unit, preserving the institution of marriage, and prioritizing the well-being of their children over their own personal happiness.\n\nOverall, the attitudes towards divorce among women in the Republic of Serbia are diverse, reflecting a range of personal beliefs, values, and experiences."
