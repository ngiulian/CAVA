                "content": "Some of the biggest challenges seniors in Finland face include social isolation, loneliness, and lack of social support. Many seniors live alone and may not have regular contact with family or friends, leading to feelings of isolation. Additionally, physical health issues such as chronic diseases and mobility limitations can pose challenges for seniors in maintaining an active and independent lifestyle. Access to healthcare services and long waiting times for medical treatments can also be a concern. Financial difficulties, especially for those with low pensions, can make it challenging for seniors to afford basic necessities and maintain a decent standard of living. Lastly, ageism and discrimination can affect seniors' opportunities for employment, social participation, and overall well-being."
