On April 4, 1960, Senegal gained its independence, becoming the first country in West Africa to break free from colonial rule. This event marked a significant milestone in Senegal's history and paved the way for the decolonization of other African nations. It led to the establishment of a sovereign Senegalese state and the beginning of a new era of self-governance and national identity."
