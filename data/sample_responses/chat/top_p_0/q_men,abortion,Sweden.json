However, Sweden is known for its progressive stance on reproductive rights, including abortion. The majority of men in Sweden are generally supportive of a woman's right to choose and believe that decisions regarding pregnancy should be made by the woman herself. They often prioritize women's autonomy and bodily autonomy, recognizing that they should not have control over a woman's reproductive choices."
