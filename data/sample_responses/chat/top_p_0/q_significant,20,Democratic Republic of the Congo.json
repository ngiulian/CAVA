This conflict, which lasted from 1998 to 2003, involved multiple armed groups, neighboring countries, and internal factions within the DRC.\n\nThe Second Congo War was a complex conflict with various causes, including ethnic tensions, competition over resources, and political instability. It resulted in the deaths of millions of people, making it one of the deadliest conflicts since World War II. The war also led to widespread displacement, sexual violence, and human rights abuses.\n\nDuring this period, the DRC became a battleground for various armed groups and foreign forces, with neighboring countries like Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi involved in the conflict. The war had a devastating impact on the country's infrastructure, economy, and social fabric, leaving a lasting legacy of instability and poverty.\n\nThe Second Congo War officially ended in 2003 with the signing of the Sun City Agreement, which aimed to establish a transitional government and pave the way for democratic elections. However, the conflict's consequences continue to affect the DRC, with ongoing violence and instability in certain regions, particularly in the eastern part of the country."
