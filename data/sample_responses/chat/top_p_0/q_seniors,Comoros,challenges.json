                "content": "Seniors in Comoros face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare, poverty, social isolation, and inadequate support systems. The healthcare system in Comoros is underdeveloped, making it difficult for seniors to access quality medical care and specialized services. Poverty is prevalent among the elderly population, leading to financial struggles and difficulties in meeting basic needs. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors often lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive support systems and programs specifically designed to address the needs of seniors in Comoros, further exacerbating their challenges."
