This revolution led to the overthrow of the Sultanate of Zanzibar and the establishment of a socialist government. The revolution was a result of tensions between the Arab ruling elite and the majority African population. It marked a significant shift in power dynamics and had a lasting impact on the political and social landscape of Zanzibar and Tanzania as a whole."
