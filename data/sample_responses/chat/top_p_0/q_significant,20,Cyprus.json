The Annan Plan was a United Nations-backed proposal to reunify the island, which had been divided since 1974 into the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus in the south and the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the north. The referendum took place on April 24, 2004, and the plan was put to a vote in both parts of the island. While the plan was accepted by the majority of Turkish Cypriots, it was rejected by the majority of Greek Cypriots. This event had a significant impact on the ongoing efforts to resolve the Cyprus dispute and reunify the island."
