                "content": "Most men in the Philippines hold conservative views on divorce and generally oppose it. They often believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and divorce goes against their cultural and religious values. Many men see divorce as a threat to the traditional family structure and believe that it can have negative consequences for children. Additionally, some men may fear the financial implications of divorce, such as potential alimony or child support payments. However, it is important to note that opinions on divorce can vary among individuals, and there are also men in the Philippines who support divorce as a means to escape abusive or unhappy marriages."
