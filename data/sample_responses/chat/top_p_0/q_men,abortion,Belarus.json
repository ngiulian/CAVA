However, based on available data and surveys, it can be said that the majority of men in Belarus tend to hold conservative views on abortion. Many men in Belarus, like in other countries, may have reservations about the practice and believe that it should be limited or restricted. Some men may consider abortion morally wrong and believe in the sanctity of life, while others may have concerns about the potential consequences of abortion on women's health. However, it is crucial to recognize that individual opinions on this topic can differ significantly, and there are men in Belarus who may hold more liberal or pro-choice views as well."
