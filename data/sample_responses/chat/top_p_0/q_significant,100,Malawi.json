On July 6, 1964, Malawi gained its independence and became a sovereign nation. This event marked a turning point in the country's history, as it ended decades of British colonialism and paved the way for self-governance and the establishment of a democratic system. The independence movement was led by Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who became the country's first president. This event not only shaped Malawi's political landscape but also had a profound impact on its social, economic, and cultural development."
