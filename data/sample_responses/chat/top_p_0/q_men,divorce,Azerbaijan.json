They generally view it as a failure and a source of shame, as it goes against traditional values and societal expectations. Men often prioritize maintaining a stable family unit and preserving their reputation within the community. Divorce is seen as a last resort, and many men prefer to endure unhappy marriages rather than face the social stigma associated with divorce."
