                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Fiji face include limited access to healthcare services, financial constraints, social isolation, and inadequate support systems. Many seniors struggle to afford medical treatments and medications due to limited income and lack of comprehensive healthcare coverage. Additionally, financial constraints often lead to difficulties in meeting basic needs such as food, housing, and transportation. Social isolation is another significant challenge as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Furthermore, inadequate support systems and limited availability of elder care services make it challenging for seniors to receive the necessary assistance and care they require."
