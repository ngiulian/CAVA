                "content": "Most men in Mauritius have a negative perception of divorce. They often view it as a failure and a source of shame, as it goes against traditional cultural values that prioritize marriage and family unity. Men tend to believe that divorce brings social stigma and can damage their reputation within their community. Additionally, they may perceive divorce as a financial burden due to potential alimony and child support obligations. Consequently, many men in Mauritius prefer to avoid divorce and instead strive to maintain their marriages, even in challenging circumstances."
