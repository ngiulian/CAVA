One of the biggest challenges is the pressure to perform well academically, as the education system is highly competitive. This can lead to stress and anxiety among teenagers. Additionally, the prevalence of substance abuse, particularly alcohol and tobacco, is a concern. Peer pressure and easy access to these substances contribute to this issue. Another challenge is the lack of opportunities for extracurricular activities and hobbies, which can limit teenagers' personal development and social interactions. Lastly, the digital age has brought about challenges such as cyberbullying and excessive screen time, affecting teenagers' mental health and social skills."
