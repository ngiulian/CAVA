In June 2009, then-President Manuel Zelaya was ousted from power by the military and sent into exile. This event sparked a political and constitutional crisis in the country, leading to widespread protests, international condemnation, and a period of political instability. The crisis resulted in a deep divide within Honduran society and had long-lasting effects on the country's political landscape."
