                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Thailand face include financial insecurity, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions or savings, making it difficult to meet their basic needs. Access to affordable healthcare is also a concern, especially for those living in rural areas. Additionally, seniors often experience social isolation due to changing family structures and urbanization, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Age discrimination in employment and societal attitudes can further hinder their opportunities and overall well-being."
