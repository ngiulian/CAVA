However, like kids in many other parts of the world, Yemeni children may be interested in various things such as technology, social media, video games, sports, music, fashion, and popular culture. It is important to note that the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Yemen may significantly impact the lives and priorities of children in the country."
