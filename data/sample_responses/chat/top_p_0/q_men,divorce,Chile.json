Many men believe that divorce is detrimental to children and can lead to emotional and psychological issues. They may also perceive divorce as a financial burden due to the potential loss of assets and the need to pay alimony or child support. Overall, most men in Chile tend to have a conservative stance on divorce and prioritize maintaining a stable and intact family unit."
