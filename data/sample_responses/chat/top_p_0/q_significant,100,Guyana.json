It was a tragic event where more than 900 members of the Peoples Temple, a religious cult led by Jim Jones, died in a mass murder-suicide. The majority of the victims were American citizens who had moved to Guyana to live in the cult's settlement known as Jonestown. This event shocked the world and had a profound impact on Guyana, leading to increased scrutiny of cults and religious organizations."
