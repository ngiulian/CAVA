However, it is worth noting that Marshall Islands is a predominantly Christian country, and Christianity generally opposes abortion. Therefore, many men in Marshall Islands may hold conservative views on abortion, considering it morally wrong and against their religious beliefs. However, it is important to recognize that there may be diverse opinions within the population, and some men may have more liberal or nuanced perspectives on the matter."
