                "content": "Teenagers in Sudan face several significant challenges. One of the biggest challenges is limited access to quality education. Many teenagers struggle to attend school due to factors such as poverty, lack of infrastructure, and ongoing conflicts. This hampers their ability to acquire necessary skills and knowledge for their future.\n\nAnother major challenge is the prevalence of child marriage, particularly among girls. Sudan has one of the highest rates of child marriage globally, with many girls being forced into early marriages, often before the age of 18. This deprives them of their rights, education, and opportunities for personal growth.\n\nTeenagers in Sudan also face economic hardships, as the country has been grappling with a struggling economy for years. High unemployment rates and limited job opportunities make it difficult for teenagers to secure employment and contribute to their families' financial stability.\n\nFurthermore, the ongoing political instability and conflicts in Sudan pose significant challenges for teenagers. They are exposed to violence, displacement, and trauma, which can have long-lasting effects on their mental and physical well-being.\n\nLastly, access to healthcare services, especially in rural areas, is limited, making it challenging for teenagers to receive proper medical care and support.\n\nOverall, the biggest challenges faced by teenagers in Sudan include limited access to education, child marriage, economic hardships, political instability, and inadequate healthcare services."
