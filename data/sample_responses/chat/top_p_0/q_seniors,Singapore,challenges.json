Many seniors struggle with inadequate retirement savings and rising living costs, making it challenging to meet their basic needs. Healthcare costs can also be a burden, especially for those with chronic illnesses or disabilities. Additionally, social isolation is a prevalent issue, as seniors may lack social connections and support networks, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Lastly, seniors often face limited employment opportunities due to age discrimination, making it difficult for them to remain active and financially independent."
