                "content": "The most significant event that happened in Venezuela in the past 5 years is the ongoing political and economic crisis that has severely impacted the country. The crisis began in 2014 with a decline in oil prices, which heavily affected Venezuela's oil-dependent economy. This led to hyperinflation, scarcity of basic goods, and a deep economic recession. The crisis also sparked widespread protests against the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has been accused of authoritarianism and human rights abuses. The political situation escalated in 2019 when opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared himself interim president, challenging Maduro's legitimacy. This led to a power struggle between the two factions, with international recognition and support divided between them. The crisis has resulted in a significant humanitarian emergency, with millions of Venezuelans fleeing the country in search of better living conditions and access to basic necessities."
