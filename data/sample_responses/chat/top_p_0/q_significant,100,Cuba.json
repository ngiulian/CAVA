Led by Fidel Castro, the revolution aimed to overthrow the authoritarian regime of Fulgencio Batista and establish a socialist government in Cuba. The revolution resulted in the establishment of a communist state, with Castro becoming the country's leader. This event had a profound impact on Cuba's political, economic, and social landscape, leading to significant changes in the country's governance, relations with the United States, and its role in the Cold War."
