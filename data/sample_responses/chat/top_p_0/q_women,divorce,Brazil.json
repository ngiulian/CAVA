                "content": "Most women in Brazil have a positive view of divorce and consider it as a viable option to end an unhappy or abusive marriage. They believe that divorce provides them with the opportunity to seek personal happiness, independence, and a chance to rebuild their lives. Many women in Brazil also view divorce as a means to escape domestic violence and improve their overall well-being. However, it is important to note that attitudes towards divorce can vary among individuals, and some women may still face societal pressure or stigma associated with divorce."
