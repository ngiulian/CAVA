It began in December 2018 and led to the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir, who had been in power for 30 years. The revolution was sparked by widespread economic hardships, high inflation, and political repression. It was a culmination of years of discontent and protests against the government. The revolution resulted in a transitional government being established, with a power-sharing agreement between the military and civilian representatives. This event marked a significant turning point in Sudan's history and brought hope for democratic reforms and a more inclusive government."
