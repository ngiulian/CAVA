After decades of conflict and a two-year-long border war between the two countries from 1998 to 2000, the peace agreement brought an end to the hostilities and marked a new era of cooperation and normalization of relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia. This event was significant as it not only ended a long-standing conflict but also opened up opportunities for economic, political, and social development in the region. It led to the reopening of borders, resumption of flights, and the establishment of diplomatic relations, fostering regional stability and integration."
