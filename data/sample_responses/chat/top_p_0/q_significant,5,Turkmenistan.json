                "content": "One of the most significant events that occurred in Turkmenistan in the past five years was the death of the country's long-serving president, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, in 2021. Berdimuhamedow had been in power since 2006 and his sudden death marked a significant transition for the country. As Turkmenistan has a highly centralized political system, his passing raised questions about the future leadership and potential political changes in the country. However, as of now, the full implications of his death and its impact on Turkmenistan's political landscape are yet to be fully realized."
