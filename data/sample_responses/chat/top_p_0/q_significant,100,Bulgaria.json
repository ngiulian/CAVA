This event occurred in 1989-1990, marking the end of the communist regime that had been in power since 1944. The fall of communism brought about significant political, economic, and social changes in Bulgaria, including the establishment of a multi-party system, market-oriented reforms, and integration into the European Union. This event had a profound impact on the country's trajectory and shaped its modern history."
