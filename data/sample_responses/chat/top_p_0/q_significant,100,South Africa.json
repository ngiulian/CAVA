Apartheid was a system of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government, which lasted from 1948 to 1994. The dismantling of apartheid and the peaceful transition to a democratic government marked a major turning point in South African history and symbolized the triumph of equality and justice. Mandela's presidency and his efforts towards reconciliation and nation-building have had a lasting impact on South Africa and the world."
