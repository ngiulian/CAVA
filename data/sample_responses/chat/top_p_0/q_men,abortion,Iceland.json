However, it is worth noting that Iceland is known for its progressive stance on reproductive rights, including access to safe and legal abortion. The country legalized abortion in 1975, making it one of the first nations to do so. Consequently, many men in Iceland may support a woman's right to choose and believe in the importance of reproductive autonomy. However, it is essential to recognize that opinions on abortion can differ among individuals, and there may be varying perspectives within the male population in Iceland."
