                "content": "Most men in Saudi Arabia generally have a negative perception of divorce. They view it as a last resort and believe that it should only be pursued in extreme cases where there is no possibility of reconciliation. Divorce is often seen as a failure and a disruption to the traditional family structure, which is highly valued in Saudi society. Men tend to prioritize maintaining the stability of the family unit and preserving their reputation within the community. However, attitudes towards divorce may vary among individuals based on their personal experiences and beliefs."
