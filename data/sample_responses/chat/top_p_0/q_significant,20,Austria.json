                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Austria in the past 20 years is the formation of a coalition government between the center-right Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) and the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6) in 2017. This event marked the return of the FP\u00d6 to government after more than a decade and generated significant controversy both domestically and internationally. The coalition's formation led to concerns about the rise of far-right politics in Austria and strained diplomatic relations with other European Union member states. However, the coalition collapsed in 2019 due to a corruption scandal, leading to a reconfiguration of the government."
