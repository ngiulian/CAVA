Walking: If the weather is pleasant and you enjoy walking, you can simply walk to the grocery store. It will take you approximately 10-15 minutes to cover a distance of 1km.\n\n2. Cycling: Malta has a growing cycling culture, and it can be a convenient and eco-friendly way to get around. If you have a bicycle, you can ride to the grocery store in about 5-10 minutes.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Malta has an extensive bus network that covers most areas of the island. You can check the local bus schedules and routes to find a bus that takes you to the grocery store. Keep in mind that bus schedules may vary, so plan accordingly.\n\n4. Taxi or Ride-Sharing: If you prefer a more convenient and direct option, you can take a taxi or use a ride-sharing service like Bolt or eCabs. This will be the quickest way to reach the grocery store, but it will also be more expensive than other options.\n\nConsider your preferences, the weather conditions, and the availability of transportation options to choose the most suitable method for your trip to the grocery store."
