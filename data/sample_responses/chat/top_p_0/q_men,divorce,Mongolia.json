                "content": "Most men in Mongolia have a negative perception of divorce. They view it as a failure and a source of shame, often blaming the woman for the breakdown of the marriage. Men tend to prioritize maintaining a stable family unit and preserving their reputation within society. Divorce is seen as a disruption to traditional gender roles and family values, and men may feel a sense of loss of control and authority. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, especially among younger generations, as they become more open to the idea of individual happiness and personal fulfillment."
