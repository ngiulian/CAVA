However, Denmark is known for its progressive stance on reproductive rights, including abortion. The majority of men in Denmark are generally supportive of a woman's right to choose and believe that decisions regarding pregnancy should be made by the woman herself. Danish society tends to prioritize individual autonomy and gender equality, which often translates into a more liberal attitude towards reproductive choices, including abortion."
