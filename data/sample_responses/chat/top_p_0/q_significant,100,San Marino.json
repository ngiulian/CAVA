This event marked a major political and social change in the country. The new constitution established a more democratic system, expanded the rights and freedoms of citizens, and introduced a bicameral parliament. It also granted women the right to vote, making San Marino one of the first countries in the world to do so. This event had a profound impact on the governance and development of San Marino, shaping its modern political landscape."
