The country has experienced recurring financial crises, leading to a lack of job security and difficulties in meeting basic needs. Additionally, access to affordable healthcare and education can be challenging, particularly for those living in rural areas. Income inequality and poverty rates are also significant challenges, affecting a large portion of the population. Political instability and corruption further exacerbate these issues, making it difficult for adults to improve their living conditions and secure a stable future."
