They believe that it allows individuals to find happiness and start anew. These men may support divorce rights and advocate for fair and equitable divorce laws.\n\nHowever, there are also men in Israel who hold more traditional views on divorce. They may perceive divorce as a failure or a breakdown of the family unit. These men may be more reluctant to pursue divorce and may prioritize maintaining the stability of the marriage, especially for the sake of children. They may prefer seeking counseling or mediation to salvage the relationship.\n\nIt is important to note that opinions on divorce can vary significantly among individuals, and these generalizations may not apply to every man in Israel."
