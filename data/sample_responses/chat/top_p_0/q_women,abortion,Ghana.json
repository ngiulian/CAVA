However, Ghana is a predominantly Christian country, and religious beliefs often influence attitudes towards abortion. Many women in Ghana hold conservative views on abortion, considering it morally wrong and against their religious beliefs. They may view it as taking a life and believe that it should only be considered in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is at risk. However, there are also women in Ghana who support a woman's right to choose and advocate for safe and legal access to abortion, recognizing the importance of reproductive rights and women's autonomy."
