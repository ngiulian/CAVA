                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Croatia face include financial difficulties, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with low pensions and rising living costs, making it difficult to meet their basic needs. Access to quality healthcare services can be limited, especially in rural areas, leading to inadequate medical care. Social isolation is a common issue as seniors may lack social connections and support networks, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and society can hinder seniors' opportunities for active participation and inclusion."
