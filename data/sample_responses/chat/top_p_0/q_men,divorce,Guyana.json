                "content": "Most men in Guyana have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a failure and a disruption to the traditional family structure. Men often believe that divorce brings shame and stigma to both parties involved, particularly for women. They tend to prioritize maintaining a stable and intact family unit, valuing commitment and loyalty in marriage. Consequently, divorce is often seen as a last resort, with men preferring to work through marital issues and find ways to reconcile rather than opting for separation."
