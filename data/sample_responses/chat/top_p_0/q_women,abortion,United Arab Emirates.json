However, the UAE follows Islamic law, which generally prohibits abortion except in certain circumstances. \n\nUnder UAE law, abortion is only permitted if the mother's life is at risk or if the fetus has severe abnormalities that would lead to significant physical or mental disabilities. In such cases, a medical committee must approve the procedure. \n\nGiven the influence of Islamic values and the legal restrictions, many women in the UAE may hold conservative views on abortion. They may generally consider it morally wrong and believe in the sanctity of life. However, it is important to recognize that individual opinions can differ, and some women may have more liberal perspectives on the matter."
