                "content": "Seniors in Malta face several challenges, including healthcare issues, financial concerns, social isolation, and age discrimination. The healthcare system may not always adequately meet their needs, leading to difficulties in accessing quality care and long waiting times for treatments. Financially, some seniors struggle with limited pensions and rising living costs, making it challenging to maintain a comfortable standard of living. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as many seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Additionally, age discrimination can hinder seniors' access to employment, services, and opportunities, limiting their overall well-being and quality of life."
