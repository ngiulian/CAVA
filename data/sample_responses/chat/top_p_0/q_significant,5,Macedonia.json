On June 17, 2018, Macedonia and Greece signed the Prespa Agreement, which ended a 27-year-long dispute over the country's name. As a result, Macedonia changed its name to North Macedonia, and Greece lifted its objections to the country's NATO and EU membership aspirations. This event marked a significant milestone in the country's international relations and opened up new opportunities for its future development."
