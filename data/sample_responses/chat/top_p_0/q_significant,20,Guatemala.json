In 2013, R\u00edos Montt became the first former head of state to be found guilty of genocide by a domestic court. He was held responsible for the massacre of more than 1,700 indigenous Mayans during the country's civil war in the early 1980s. This landmark trial marked a significant step towards justice and accountability for the human rights abuses committed during Guatemala's civil war. However, the conviction was later overturned on procedural grounds, and a new trial was ordered. Despite subsequent legal challenges, the initial conviction remains a significant event in Guatemala's recent history."
