However, it is worth noting that Papua New Guinea is a predominantly Christian country, and religious beliefs often shape attitudes towards abortion. Christianity generally opposes abortion, considering it morally wrong. Consequently, many men in Papua New Guinea may hold conservative views on the matter, aligning with their religious beliefs. However, it is important to recognize that there may be diverse opinions among men in the country, influenced by factors such as education, personal experiences, and cultural perspectives."
