                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Bolivia face include limited access to healthcare, poverty and financial insecurity, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, leading to inadequate treatment and health issues. Poverty rates among seniors are high, with limited pension benefits and lack of financial support, making it difficult for them to meet their basic needs. Social isolation is another challenge as seniors often lack social connections and support networks, leading to loneliness and mental health issues. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and society further marginalizes seniors, limiting their opportunities and access to resources."
