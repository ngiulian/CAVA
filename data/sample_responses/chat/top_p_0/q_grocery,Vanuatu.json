Walking: If the weather is pleasant and you enjoy walking, you can simply walk to the grocery store. It will take approximately 10-15 minutes to cover a distance of 1km.\n\n2. Bicycling: If you have access to a bicycle, it can be a convenient and faster way to reach the grocery store. It will take around 3-5 minutes to cover the distance on a bicycle.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Depending on the availability of public transportation in your area, you can check if there are buses or minivans that pass by or near the grocery store. This can be a cost-effective option, but make sure to check the schedules and routes in advance.\n\n4. Taxi: Taxis are usually available in urban areas of Vanuatu. You can hail a taxi and provide the address of the grocery store to the driver. Taxis are more expensive than other options, but they offer convenience and a direct route.\n\n5. Car Rental: If you have access to a car or can rent one, driving to the grocery store is another option. It will provide you with flexibility and convenience, especially if you have a lot of groceries to carry back home.\n\nConsider the available options based on your preferences, budget, and the resources at your disposal."
