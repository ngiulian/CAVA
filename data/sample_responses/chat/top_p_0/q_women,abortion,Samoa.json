                "content": "Most women in Samoa hold conservative views on abortion and generally oppose it. They believe that life begins at conception and consider abortion to be morally wrong. They prioritize the value of preserving life and often view abortion as a violation of cultural and religious beliefs. Additionally, societal and familial pressures, as well as the influence of traditional gender roles, contribute to the prevailing negative attitudes towards abortion among women in Samoa."
