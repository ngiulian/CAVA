The country has been grappling with a high youth unemployment rate, making it difficult for teenagers to find stable employment opportunities. Additionally, the education system faces challenges such as overcrowded classrooms, lack of resources, and limited vocational training options, which can hinder teenagers' educational prospects. Mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, are also prevalent among Spanish teenagers, often due to academic pressure, social media, and societal expectations. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drug use, is another challenge faced by some teenagers in Spain. Lastly, teenagers may also experience social pressures related to body image, peer acceptance, and conformity, which can impact their overall well-being."
