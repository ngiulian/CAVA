However, it is worth noting that Papua New Guinea is a predominantly Christian country, and religious beliefs often influence attitudes towards abortion. Christianity generally opposes abortion, considering it morally wrong. Additionally, cultural and societal factors may also play a role in shaping opinions on this issue. It is important to recognize that there may be diverse perspectives among women in Papua New Guinea, and individual opinions may differ from the general trends."
