This election resulted in the victory of the Reform Party, led by Kaja Kallas, becoming the largest party in the Riigikogu (Estonian Parliament). This marked a significant shift in Estonian politics, as the previous ruling party, the Centre Party, lost its majority. Kaja Kallas subsequently became the first female Prime Minister of Estonia, forming a coalition government with the Centre Party. This election and the subsequent change in government had a significant impact on Estonian politics and governance."
