                "content": "Most women in Mongolia have a negative perception of divorce. They view it as a last resort and believe that it should only be considered in extreme circumstances. Women in Mongolia generally prioritize maintaining a stable and harmonious family life, and divorce is seen as a disruption to this ideal. They often feel societal pressure to stay in unhappy marriages for the sake of their children and to avoid being stigmatized by their community. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, especially among younger generations, as women are becoming more empowered and seeking greater independence and happiness in their relationships."
