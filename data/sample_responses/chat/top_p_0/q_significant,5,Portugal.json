In June and October of that year, Portugal experienced two major wildfire outbreaks, resulting in the loss of hundreds of lives and causing extensive damage to homes, infrastructure, and natural landscapes. These fires were some of the deadliest in the country's history and led to significant discussions and reforms regarding forest management, emergency response systems, and prevention strategies. The tragic events prompted a national reflection on the country's preparedness and response to such disasters, leading to efforts to improve firefighting capabilities and implement measures to prevent future wildfires."
