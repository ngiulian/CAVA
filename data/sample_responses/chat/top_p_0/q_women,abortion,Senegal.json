                "content": "Most women in Senegal hold conservative views on abortion and generally oppose it. They consider abortion to be morally wrong and against their religious beliefs, which are predominantly influenced by Islam. Senegal is a predominantly Muslim country, and Islamic teachings generally prohibit abortion except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. Women in Senegal often prioritize the value of preserving life and view abortion as a violation of this principle. Additionally, societal and cultural norms in Senegal place a strong emphasis on family and motherhood, further contributing to the negative perception of abortion among women in the country."
