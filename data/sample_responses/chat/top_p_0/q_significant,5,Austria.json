In May 2019, a video was released showing the leader of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6), Heinz-Christian Strache, and his deputy, Johann Gudenus, discussing potential corruption and illegal activities with a woman posing as a Russian oligarch's niece. The video led to the resignation of Strache and the collapse of the coalition government between the FP\u00d6 and the Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP). This event had a major impact on Austrian politics, leading to early elections and a reshaping of the political landscape in the country."
