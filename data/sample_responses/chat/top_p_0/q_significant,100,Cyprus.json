The conflict began in the mid-20th century and has had a lasting impact on the island's political, social, and cultural landscape.\n\nThe conflict can be traced back to tensions between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities, which escalated after Cyprus gained independence from British colonial rule in 1960. In 1974, a Greek military junta supported a coup attempt by Greek Cypriot nationalists seeking to unite Cyprus with Greece. In response, Turkey invaded Cyprus, leading to the division of the island into the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus in the south, predominantly inhabited by Greek Cypriots, and the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the north, predominantly inhabited by Turkish Cypriots.\n\nThe division of Cyprus has had significant consequences, including the displacement of thousands of people, ongoing political tensions, and a United Nations peacekeeping mission that remains in place to this day. The conflict has also hindered efforts to find a peaceful resolution and reunify the island, despite numerous negotiations and initiatives over the years.\n\nThe Cyprus conflict and division have had a profound impact on the island's history, politics, and society, making it one of the most significant events in Cyprus in the past century."
