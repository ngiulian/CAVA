                "content": "Seniors in Bulgaria face several challenges, including financial difficulties, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with low pensions and inadequate savings, making it difficult for them to afford basic necessities and healthcare expenses. The healthcare system in Bulgaria often lacks sufficient resources and specialized services for the elderly, leading to difficulties in accessing quality medical care. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may lack social connections and support networks, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Additionally, age discrimination is prevalent in various aspects of life, including employment opportunities and access to public services, which can further marginalize and disadvantage seniors in Bulgaria."
