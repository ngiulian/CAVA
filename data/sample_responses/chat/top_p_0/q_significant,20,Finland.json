This election marked a major shift in Finnish politics as the right-wing populist party, True Finns (now known as the Finns Party), gained significant support and became the third-largest party in the Finnish Parliament. This election result had a profound impact on Finnish politics, leading to changes in government policies and a shift in the political landscape of the country."
