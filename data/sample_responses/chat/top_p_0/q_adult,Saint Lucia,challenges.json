The country's economy heavily relies on tourism, which can be seasonal and unstable, leading to job insecurity. Additionally, access to affordable housing is a significant challenge, with many adults struggling to find suitable and affordable accommodation. Health care services, particularly in rural areas, may be limited, making it difficult for adults to access quality healthcare. Education and skills training opportunities are also limited, hindering adults' ability to acquire the necessary skills for better job prospects. Finally, crime rates and safety concerns can pose challenges for adults, affecting their overall well-being and quality of life."
