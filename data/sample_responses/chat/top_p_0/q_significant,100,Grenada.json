This event, known as Operation Urgent Fury, was a military intervention by the United States and several Caribbean nations. It was triggered by a coup d'\u00e9tat in Grenada, where the Marxist-Leninist government of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was overthrown and subsequently executed. The invasion aimed to restore order, protect American citizens, and prevent the establishment of a Soviet-aligned government in the region. The intervention had a lasting impact on Grenada's political landscape and international relations."
