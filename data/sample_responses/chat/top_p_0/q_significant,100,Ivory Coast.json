The conflict began as a result of political and ethnic tensions between the northern and southern regions of the country. It led to a division of the country, with rebel forces controlling the north and the government controlling the south. The civil war resulted in thousands of deaths, displacement of people, and severe economic consequences for the country. It also had a lasting impact on the political landscape and social fabric of Ivory Coast."
