On October 17, 2018, Canada became the second country in the world, after Uruguay, to legalize the recreational use of marijuana nationwide. This event had a significant impact on Canadian society, economy, and legal framework. It brought about changes in drug policy, created a new industry, and sparked debates on various social, health, and legal issues. The legalization of cannabis in Canada has also influenced discussions and policies regarding drug reform in other countries."
