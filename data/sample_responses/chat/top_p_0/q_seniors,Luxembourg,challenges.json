Many seniors in Luxembourg experience loneliness and isolation due to factors such as living alone, limited social interactions, and the loss of friends and family members. Financial insecurity is another significant challenge, as some seniors struggle to make ends meet with their pensions or face rising costs of living. Additionally, accessing quality healthcare services can be a challenge for seniors, especially those with limited mobility or chronic health conditions."
