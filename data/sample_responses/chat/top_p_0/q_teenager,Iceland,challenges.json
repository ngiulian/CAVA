The high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and suicide rates among Icelandic teenagers is a significant concern. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drug use, is also a major challenge, with many teenagers engaging in risky behaviors. Peer pressure plays a role in these issues, as teenagers often feel pressured to conform to certain social norms and behaviors. Additionally, the limited availability of safe and engaging social activities can lead to boredom and potentially unhealthy behaviors."
