This conflict started with Russia's annexation of Crimea and subsequent support for separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. The conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths, displacement of people, and significant political and economic consequences for Ukraine. It has also strained relations between Russia and the international community, leading to sanctions and diplomatic tensions."
