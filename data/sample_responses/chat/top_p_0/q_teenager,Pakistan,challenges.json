                "content": "Teenagers in Pakistan face several significant challenges. One of the biggest challenges is limited access to quality education. Many teenagers, especially those from low-income families or rural areas, struggle to receive proper education due to a lack of schools, resources, and qualified teachers.\n\nAnother major challenge is the prevalence of child labor. Many teenagers are forced to work at a young age to support their families, which hinders their educational opportunities and overall development.\n\nTeenagers in Pakistan also face social and cultural pressures, particularly regarding gender roles and expectations. Traditional norms and conservative attitudes often restrict their freedom and limit their choices in terms of education, career, and personal relationships.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of child marriage is a significant challenge for teenagers, especially girls. Forced marriages at a young age not only disrupt their education but also expose them to various health risks and limit their future prospects.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of awareness and access to reproductive health services poses challenges for teenagers, leading to a high rate of teenage pregnancies and related health issues.\n\nLastly, the security situation in certain areas of Pakistan poses a significant challenge for teenagers. The threat of violence, terrorism, and extremism affects their safety, mental well-being, and overall development."
