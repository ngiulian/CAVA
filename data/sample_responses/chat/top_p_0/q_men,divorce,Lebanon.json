                "content": "Most men in Lebanon have mixed opinions about divorce. Some view it as a necessary solution to unhappy marriages, while others consider it a taboo and believe in preserving the sanctity of marriage. There is a prevailing societal expectation for men to maintain a strong commitment to their marital vows, and divorce is often seen as a failure or a sign of weakness. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually evolving, with more men recognizing the importance of personal happiness and the need for healthy relationships."
