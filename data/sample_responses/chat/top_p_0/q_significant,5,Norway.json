A right-wing extremist named Anders Behring Breivik carried out a bombing in Oslo, targeting government buildings, and later went on a shooting spree at a youth camp on the island of Ut\u00f8ya. This tragic event resulted in the deaths of 77 people, mostly teenagers, and left a lasting impact on the country."
