The country was severely affected by the epidemic, which claimed the lives of over 3,500 Sierra Leoneans and had a devastating impact on the economy and healthcare system. The outbreak highlighted the country's vulnerability to public health emergencies and led to significant efforts in strengthening healthcare infrastructure and preparedness for future outbreaks."
