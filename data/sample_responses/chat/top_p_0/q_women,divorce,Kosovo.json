                "content": "It is important to note that opinions on divorce can vary among individuals, and it is not possible to generalize the views of all women in Kosovo. However, in Kosovo, as in many societies, divorce is generally considered a complex and sensitive issue. Some women may view divorce as a necessary step to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, seeking personal freedom and independence. Others may see divorce as a last resort, preferring to work on their relationships and maintain the family unit. Cultural and societal factors, such as traditional gender roles and expectations, may influence women's perspectives on divorce. Ultimately, women's views on divorce in Kosovo can be diverse and influenced by personal experiences, beliefs, and circumstances."
