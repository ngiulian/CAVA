This event marked a major milestone in the country's history as it established Andorra as a parliamentary democracy and granted it greater autonomy. Prior to the constitution, Andorra was governed under a feudal system with limited political rights. The signing of the constitution paved the way for political and social reforms, including the establishment of political parties, the separation of powers, and the recognition of individual rights and freedoms. This event has had a lasting impact on Andorran society and its political landscape."
