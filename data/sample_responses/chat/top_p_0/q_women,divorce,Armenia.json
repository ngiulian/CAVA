                "content": "Most women in Armenia have a negative perception of divorce and consider it as a last resort. They generally believe in the importance of maintaining a stable and harmonious family life. Divorce is often seen as a failure and a source of shame, as societal and cultural norms place a strong emphasis on the preservation of marriage. Women may feel societal pressure to endure difficult marriages, prioritize their children's well-being, and maintain the family unit. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually evolving, especially among younger generations, as they seek more autonomy, independence, and equality within their relationships."
