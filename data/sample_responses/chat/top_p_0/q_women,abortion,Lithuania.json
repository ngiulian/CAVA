However, based on available data and surveys, it can be said that the majority of women in Lithuania hold conservative views on abortion.\n\nLithuania is a predominantly Catholic country, and the influence of religious beliefs plays a significant role in shaping attitudes towards abortion. The Catholic Church strongly opposes abortion, considering it morally wrong and a violation of the sanctity of life. As a result, many women in Lithuania, particularly those who are religious, tend to hold similar views and are against the practice of abortion.\n\nFurthermore, Lithuania has relatively restrictive abortion laws compared to some other European countries. Abortion is legal but subject to certain conditions, such as requiring a woman to undergo counseling and a waiting period before the procedure can be performed. These regulations may also contribute to a more conservative stance on abortion among women in Lithuania.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that there are also women in Lithuania who support a woman's right to choose and advocate for more liberal abortion laws. These individuals often emphasize the importance of women's reproductive rights, access to safe and legal abortion, and the ability to make decisions about their own bodies.\n\nOverall, while there is a significant portion of women in Lithuania who hold conservative views on abortion due to religious and cultural factors, there are also women who support a woman's right to choose and advocate for more liberal abortion laws."
