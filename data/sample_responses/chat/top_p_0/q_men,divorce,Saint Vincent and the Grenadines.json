They generally believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and divorce is seen as a failure or a sign of weakness. Men often prioritize maintaining the family unit and preserving the institution of marriage. They may view divorce as a disruption to social and cultural norms, and may be influenced by religious beliefs that discourage divorce."
