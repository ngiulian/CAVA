They view it as a viable option to end an unhappy or dysfunctional marriage. Women in the country generally prioritize their personal happiness and well-being over societal expectations or traditional norms. They believe that divorce can provide them with the opportunity to start afresh and find a more fulfilling relationship. Additionally, women in the Czech Republic tend to have a strong support system from family and friends, which further encourages them to consider divorce if they are unhappy in their marriage."
