This tragic event involved a white supremacist gunman who targeted two mosques in Christchurch, killing 51 people and injuring many others. It was the deadliest mass shooting in New Zealand's history and had a profound impact on the country. The event led to a nationwide outpouring of grief, discussions on gun control, and a renewed focus on combating hate speech and extremism."
