The education system in Macedonia is often criticized for its outdated curriculum and lack of resources, making it difficult for teenagers to acquire the necessary skills for future employment. Additionally, the country's high unemployment rates make it challenging for teenagers to find job opportunities and gain financial independence. Furthermore, access to quality healthcare services is limited, particularly in rural areas, which can negatively impact teenagers' physical and mental well-being."
