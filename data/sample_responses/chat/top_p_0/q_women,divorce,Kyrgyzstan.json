                "content": "Most women in Kyrgyzstan have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women view divorce as a last resort to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others consider it a social stigma and a failure of their role as a wife. The perception of divorce is influenced by cultural and societal norms, religious beliefs, and personal experiences. Many women prioritize maintaining the family unit and may endure difficult marriages for the sake of their children or due to financial dependence. However, with changing attitudes and increasing awareness about women's rights, some women are becoming more open to the idea of divorce as a means to seek personal happiness and independence."
