They view it as a common and acceptable solution to marital problems, rather than stigmatizing it. Men in the Netherlands generally believe that divorce is a personal decision that should be made if a relationship is no longer fulfilling or healthy. They prioritize individual happiness and personal growth, and understand that divorce can be a way to achieve these goals. Additionally, Dutch men tend to support the idea of shared parenting and believe that both parents should have equal rights and responsibilities after divorce."
