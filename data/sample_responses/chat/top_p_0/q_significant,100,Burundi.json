The genocide was a result of ethnic tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi populations in the country. It is estimated that between 80,000 and 210,000 people, mostly Hutus, were killed during the violence. The event had a profound impact on the country's history, politics, and social fabric, leading to further conflicts and instability in subsequent years."
