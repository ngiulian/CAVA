They generally view divorce as a social taboo and believe that it goes against the cultural and religious values of the country. Men often consider divorce as a failure and a sign of weakness in maintaining a stable and successful marriage. They may also perceive divorce as a threat to their reputation and social standing within the community. Consequently, many men in Maldives strive to avoid divorce and prioritize maintaining a harmonious and long-lasting marriage."
