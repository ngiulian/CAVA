                "content": "Most men in Indonesia hold negative views towards divorce. They generally perceive divorce as a last resort and believe that it should be avoided if possible. Men often prioritize maintaining the stability of the family unit and preserving societal norms and values. They may view divorce as a failure and a source of shame, as it goes against traditional gender roles and expectations. Additionally, men may be concerned about the financial and social consequences of divorce, such as losing assets or facing social stigma. However, it is important to note that attitudes towards divorce can vary among individuals based on factors such as education, urbanization, and exposure to different cultural influences."
