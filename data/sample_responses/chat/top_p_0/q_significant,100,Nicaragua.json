The revolution was a violent struggle against the Somoza dictatorship, led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). It resulted in the overthrow of the Somoza regime and the establishment of a socialist government under the leadership of the FSLN. The revolution had a profound impact on Nicaraguan society, politics, and economy, and it also had regional and international implications."
