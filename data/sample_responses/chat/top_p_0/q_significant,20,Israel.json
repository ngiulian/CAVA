This event involved the unilateral withdrawal of Israeli settlers and military forces from the Gaza Strip, which had been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War. The disengagement aimed to reduce tensions and pave the way for a potential peace agreement with the Palestinians. However, it also led to significant political and social upheaval within Israel, as well as increased conflict with Palestinian militant groups in Gaza."
