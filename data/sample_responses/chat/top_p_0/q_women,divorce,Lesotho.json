                "content": "Most women in Lesotho have a negative perception of divorce. They view it as a last resort and believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment. Divorce is often seen as a failure and brings social stigma to women, affecting their reputation and social standing. Women may endure unhappy marriages due to societal pressure, economic dependence, and fear of being ostracized. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, especially among younger generations, as they seek more autonomy and equality in relationships."
