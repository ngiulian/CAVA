                "content": "Seniors in the Czech Republic face several challenges. One of the biggest challenges is financial insecurity, as many seniors struggle with low pensions and rising living costs. This often leads to difficulties in meeting basic needs and accessing healthcare services. Another challenge is social isolation, as seniors may experience loneliness and lack of social interaction, especially if they live alone or have limited mobility. Access to quality healthcare and long-term care services is also a concern, with long waiting times and limited availability of specialized care. Additionally, there is a lack of age-friendly infrastructure and transportation options, making it harder for seniors to navigate their surroundings. Finally, there is a need for better awareness and support for mental health issues among seniors, as depression and anxiety are prevalent but often overlooked."
