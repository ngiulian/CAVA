Antarctica is a remote and sparsely populated continent, primarily inhabited by scientists and researchers who temporarily reside there for work purposes. The population is highly transient, and the number of women living in Antarctica is relatively small. Therefore, it is not feasible to make generalizations about their opinions on divorce."
