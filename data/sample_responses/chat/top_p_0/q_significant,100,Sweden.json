On February 28, 1986, Palme was shot dead while walking home from the cinema with his wife in Stockholm. This event shocked the nation and had a profound impact on Swedish society. Palme was a prominent figure in Swedish politics, known for his progressive policies and strong advocacy for social justice. His assassination led to a period of national mourning and a significant shift in Swedish politics. The crime remained unsolved for many years, until a suspect was convicted in 2021, more than three decades after the assassination. The event continues to be remembered as a defining moment in Swedish history."
