On August 21, 1991, Latvia declared its independence from the Soviet Union, marking the end of over 50 years of Soviet occupation. This event was a culmination of the Baltic Way, a peaceful demonstration in 1989 when around two million people joined hands to form a human chain across Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, demanding independence. The restoration of Latvia's independence paved the way for the country's democratic development, economic growth, and integration into the European Union and NATO."
