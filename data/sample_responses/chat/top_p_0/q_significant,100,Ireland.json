This agreement marked a major milestone in the Northern Ireland peace process, bringing an end to decades of conflict known as \"The Troubles.\" The Good Friday Agreement established a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, recognized the principle of consent for any change in the region's constitutional status, and created institutions for cross-border cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It has played a crucial role in maintaining peace and stability in the region since its signing."
