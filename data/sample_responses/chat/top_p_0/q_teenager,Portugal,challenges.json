The country has been struggling with a high youth unemployment rate, making it difficult for teenagers to find job opportunities and gain financial independence. Additionally, the education system faces challenges such as overcrowded classrooms and limited resources, which can hinder teenagers' academic development. Mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, are also prevalent among Portuguese teenagers, often due to academic pressure, social media influence, and societal expectations. These challenges can have a significant impact on their overall well-being and future prospects."
