                "content": "Seniors in Saint Lucia face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare services, financial insecurity, social isolation, and age discrimination. The healthcare system in Saint Lucia may not adequately cater to the specific needs of seniors, leading to difficulties in accessing quality healthcare. Financial insecurity is another significant challenge, as many seniors struggle to meet their basic needs due to limited retirement savings and inadequate pension plans. Social isolation is a concern, especially for those living alone or without family support, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and societal attitudes can limit opportunities for seniors to remain active and engaged in their communities."
