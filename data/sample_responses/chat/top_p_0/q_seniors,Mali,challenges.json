                "content": "Seniors in Mali face several significant challenges. Firstly, healthcare is a major concern as access to quality medical services is limited, especially in rural areas. Many seniors suffer from chronic diseases and lack proper medical facilities and resources. Secondly, poverty is prevalent among seniors, with a significant portion living in extreme poverty. This leads to inadequate nutrition, housing, and overall living conditions. Thirdly, social isolation is a challenge as seniors often lack social support networks and opportunities for engagement, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Additionally, limited access to education and employment opportunities further exacerbate their vulnerability. Finally, the lack of comprehensive social security systems and pension schemes leaves many seniors financially insecure and dependent on their families for support."
