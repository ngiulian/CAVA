                "content": "Most men in Guinea Bissau hold negative views towards divorce. They generally perceive divorce as a social taboo and believe that it goes against traditional values and norms. Men often view divorce as a failure of the husband to fulfill his responsibilities and maintain a stable family unit. They may also associate divorce with shame and loss of social status. Consequently, men in Guinea Bissau tend to discourage divorce and prioritize maintaining marital harmony, even in challenging circumstances."
