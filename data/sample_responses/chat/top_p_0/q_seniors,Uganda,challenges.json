                "content": "Seniors in Uganda face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare and social services, poverty and financial insecurity, inadequate pension systems, lack of social support networks, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare and may not have access to necessary medications or treatments. Poverty is a significant issue, with a large portion of seniors living in poverty and lacking financial security. The pension systems in Uganda are often insufficient, leaving many seniors without a reliable source of income. Additionally, seniors may lack social support networks, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Age discrimination is prevalent, with seniors facing stereotypes and exclusion from certain opportunities and resources."
