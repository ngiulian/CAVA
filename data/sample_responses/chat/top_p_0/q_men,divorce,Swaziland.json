                "content": "Most men in Swaziland hold negative views towards divorce. They consider divorce to be a disgraceful and shameful act that goes against cultural and religious values. Men often perceive divorce as a failure to fulfill their responsibilities as husbands and providers. They believe that divorce brings shame to their families and communities, and it is seen as a sign of weakness and inability to maintain a stable marriage. Consequently, men in Swaziland generally strive to avoid divorce and prioritize maintaining their marriages, even in challenging circumstances."
