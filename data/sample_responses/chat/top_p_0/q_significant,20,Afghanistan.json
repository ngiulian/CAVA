This event marked the beginning of the War in Afghanistan, which aimed to dismantle the Taliban regime and eliminate Al-Qaeda's presence in the country. The invasion led to the overthrow of the Taliban government, but the conflict continued for years, resulting in a protracted war with significant consequences for Afghanistan and the international community."
