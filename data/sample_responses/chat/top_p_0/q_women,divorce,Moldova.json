                "content": "Most women in Moldova have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a last resort and believe that marriage should be a lifelong commitment. Divorce is often seen as a failure and carries a social stigma, particularly in more traditional and conservative communities. Women may feel pressured to stay in unhappy marriages due to societal expectations, fear of judgment, or concerns about financial stability. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, especially among younger generations who are more influenced by Western values and seek personal happiness and fulfillment in relationships."
