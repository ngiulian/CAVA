The country's economy heavily relies on agriculture, which can be affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes. This leads to a lack of stable employment and income for many adults. Additionally, access to quality healthcare and education can be limited, especially in rural areas. The cost of living is relatively high, making it difficult for adults to afford basic necessities. Furthermore, the country's aging population poses challenges in terms of healthcare and social support for older adults."
