Additionally, there are issues related to corruption, political instability, and a lack of trust in the government. Access to quality healthcare and education is also a concern, as well as the need for better infrastructure and public services. Discrimination, particularly against marginalized groups such as ethnic minorities and the LGBTQ+ community, is another challenge faced by adults in Macedonia."
