                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Indonesia face include limited access to healthcare and social services, financial insecurity, lack of employment opportunities, and social isolation. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare and face difficulties in accessing quality medical facilities. Additionally, a significant portion of seniors in Indonesia live in poverty and lack financial support, making it challenging for them to meet their basic needs. The lack of employment opportunities for seniors further exacerbates their financial insecurity. Moreover, social isolation is a common issue as seniors often experience neglect and abandonment, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression."
