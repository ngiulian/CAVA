This election marked a significant turning point in the country's political landscape. Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, the candidate from the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), won the election, defeating the incumbent president Abdulla Yameen. This election was seen as a victory for democracy and brought an end to Yameen's authoritarian rule, which was marred by allegations of corruption and human rights abuses. The election also led to a peaceful transfer of power, signaling a new era of political stability and democratic governance in the Maldives."
