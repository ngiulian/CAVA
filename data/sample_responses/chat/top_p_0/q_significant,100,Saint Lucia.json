On February 22, 1979, Saint Lucia gained full independence, becoming a sovereign nation. This event marked a significant milestone in the country's history, as it allowed the people of Saint Lucia to govern themselves and shape their own future. Independence Day is now celebrated annually as a national holiday, commemorating this important event."
