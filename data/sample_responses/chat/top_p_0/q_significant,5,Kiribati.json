The government of Kiribati purchased 20 square kilometers of land on the island of Vanua Levu in Fiji, as a potential refuge for its citizens in the face of rising sea levels and the threat of climate change. This decision highlighted the grave concerns Kiribati faces due to its low-lying geography and the potential displacement of its population in the future. The purchase of land in Fiji was seen as a proactive step towards ensuring the safety and security of Kiribati's people in the face of climate change impacts."
