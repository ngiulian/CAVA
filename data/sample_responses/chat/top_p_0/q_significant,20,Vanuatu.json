Cyclone Pam was one of the strongest tropical cyclones to hit the Pacific region, causing widespread destruction and loss of life in Vanuatu. The category 5 cyclone brought destructive winds, storm surges, and heavy rainfall, resulting in the destruction of homes, infrastructure, and agricultural lands. The event had a significant impact on the country's economy and livelihoods, with an estimated 64,000 people affected and 11 deaths reported. The international community provided aid and support to help Vanuatu recover from the disaster."
