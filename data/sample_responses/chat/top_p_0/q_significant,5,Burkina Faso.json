Compaor\u00e9 had been in power for 27 years and was attempting to amend the constitution to extend his rule. This led to widespread protests and eventually a military coup, resulting in his resignation and exile. This event marked a significant turning point in Burkina Faso's political landscape and set the stage for subsequent political transitions and challenges in the country."
