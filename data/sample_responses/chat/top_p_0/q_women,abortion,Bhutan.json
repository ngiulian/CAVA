However, Bhutan is a predominantly Buddhist country where cultural and religious beliefs often influence people's perspectives on abortion.\n\nIn Bhutan, Buddhism plays a significant role in shaping societal values and norms. The religion generally promotes respect for life and discourages the intentional taking of life, including abortion. As a result, many women in Bhutan may hold conservative views on abortion, considering it morally wrong and against their religious beliefs.\n\nFurthermore, Bhutanese society places great importance on family and community values. Traditional gender roles and expectations often emphasize the role of women as caregivers and nurturers. Consequently, some women may feel a strong sense of responsibility towards their unborn child and may be more inclined to choose to continue with the pregnancy rather than opt for abortion.\n\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that individual perspectives on abortion can differ based on personal circumstances, education, and exposure to different ideas. Some women in Bhutan may support a woman's right to choose and advocate for access to safe and legal abortion services. These views may be influenced by factors such as personal autonomy, reproductive health, and the desire to have control over one's body and future.\n\nOverall, while many women in Bhutan may hold conservative views on abortion due to cultural and religious influences, it is crucial to acknowledge that opinions can vary among individuals, and there may be a diversity of perspectives on this"
