The country had been under Portuguese rule for over 500 years, and the independence marked a significant turning point in its history.\n\nThe independence movement in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe was led by the Movement for the Liberation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (MLSTP), which fought for self-determination and an end to colonial rule. The country's first president, Manuel Pinto da Costa, was elected shortly after independence.\n\nThis event not only marked the end of colonialism in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe but also paved the way for the country's development as a sovereign nation. It allowed the people of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe to shape their own political, social, and economic future, and it remains a significant milestone in the country's history."
