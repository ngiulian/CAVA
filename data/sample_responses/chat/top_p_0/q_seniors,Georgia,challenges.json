                "content": "Seniors in Georgia face several challenges, including healthcare access and affordability, financial insecurity, social isolation, and limited transportation options. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, especially those without insurance or with limited coverage. Financial insecurity is a significant concern, as some seniors have inadequate retirement savings or rely solely on social security benefits. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, leading to loneliness and mental health issues. Additionally, limited transportation options make it difficult for seniors to access essential services, such as medical appointments or grocery shopping, particularly in rural areas."
