This plan aimed to address the country's high levels of violence and gang-related crime. It involved a comprehensive approach that included increased security measures, social programs, and economic development initiatives. The plan led to a temporary reduction in homicide rates, but it also faced criticism for its heavy-handed approach and potential human rights abuses."
