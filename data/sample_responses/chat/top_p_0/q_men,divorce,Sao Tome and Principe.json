However, it is worth noting that divorce is generally considered a social taboo in the country, and traditional values often discourage the dissolution of marriages. Many men may view divorce as a failure or a sign of personal and societal disapproval. However, it is important to recognize that attitudes towards divorce are evolving, and there may be men who have more progressive views and support the idea of divorce as a means to end an unhappy or unhealthy marriage."
