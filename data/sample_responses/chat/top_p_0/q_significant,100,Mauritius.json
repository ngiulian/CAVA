On March 12, 1968, Mauritius became an independent nation after nearly 200 years of British control. This event marked a turning point in the country's history, leading to the establishment of a democratic government and the development of its own identity and culture. Independence Day is now celebrated annually on March 12th, commemorating this momentous event in Mauritius' history."
