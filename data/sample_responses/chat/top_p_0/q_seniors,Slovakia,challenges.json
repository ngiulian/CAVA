                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Slovakia face include financial difficulties, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with low pensions and rising living costs, making it difficult to meet their basic needs. Additionally, the healthcare system often fails to adequately address the specific health issues faced by older individuals. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Lastly, age discrimination in employment and society can hinder seniors' ability to find work or participate fully in various activities, limiting their overall quality of life."
