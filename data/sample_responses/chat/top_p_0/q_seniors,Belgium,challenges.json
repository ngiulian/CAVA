Many seniors struggle with loneliness and lack of social interaction, which can negatively impact their mental and physical well-being. Financial insecurity is another challenge, as some seniors may have limited income or face difficulties in managing their expenses. Access to quality healthcare services, especially for those with chronic illnesses, can be a challenge for seniors. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and societal attitudes can hinder seniors' opportunities for work and social participation."
