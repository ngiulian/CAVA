However, in Estonia, a country known for its progressive stance on social issues, including reproductive rights, the majority of men tend to support a woman's right to choose and have access to safe and legal abortion. Estonia has relatively liberal abortion laws, allowing women to make decisions about their own bodies without significant legal restrictions. Consequently, many men in Estonia likely respect and support a woman's autonomy in making decisions regarding pregnancy and abortion."
