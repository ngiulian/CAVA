Women's perspectives on divorce in Latvia, as in any other country, depend on various factors such as personal experiences, cultural background, education, and individual values. Some women in Latvia may view divorce as a viable option to end an unhappy or abusive marriage, while others may prioritize maintaining the family unit and may be more hesitant to consider divorce. It is important to recognize that generalizations about the views of an entire group of people can oversimplify the diversity of opinions and experiences within that group."
