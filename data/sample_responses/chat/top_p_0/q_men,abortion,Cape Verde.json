However, it is worth noting that Cape Verde is a predominantly Catholic country, and Catholic teachings generally oppose abortion. As a result, many men in Cape Verde may hold conservative views on abortion and consider it morally wrong. However, it is important to recognize that there may be diverse opinions within the population, and some men may have more liberal or nuanced perspectives on the matter."
