                "content": "Teenagers in Dominica face several challenges, including limited educational opportunities, high rates of unemployment, limited access to healthcare, and exposure to drugs and crime. The island's small size and limited resources contribute to these challenges, making it difficult for teenagers to access quality education and find employment opportunities. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive healthcare services and facilities can hinder their access to necessary medical care. The prevalence of drugs and crime in some areas further exposes teenagers to potential risks and negative influences. Overall, these challenges can impact their overall well-being and future prospects."
