On April 18, 1980, Zimbabwe gained independence after a long struggle against white minority rule. This event marked the end of the Rhodesian Bush War and the establishment of a new nation. Robert Mugabe became the country's first black Prime Minister, later serving as President for several decades. The independence of Zimbabwe had a profound impact on the country's political, social, and economic landscape, shaping its trajectory in the years to come."
