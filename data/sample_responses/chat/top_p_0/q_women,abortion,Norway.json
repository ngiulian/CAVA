                "content": "Most women in Norway generally support the right to abortion and view it as a personal choice. They believe that women should have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health. The majority of Norwegian women consider abortion as an essential part of women's rights and gender equality. They value the accessibility and availability of safe and legal abortion services, which are provided by the Norwegian healthcare system. However, it is important to note that opinions on abortion can vary among individuals, and not all women in Norway may hold the same perspective."
