                "content": "Most women in Vanuatu have a negative view of divorce. They generally believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and divorce is seen as a failure or a last resort. Women prioritize maintaining the family unit and often endure difficult situations in their marriages for the sake of their children and societal expectations. Divorce is considered a taboo and can lead to social stigma and exclusion. However, attitudes towards divorce may vary among individuals and younger generations are gradually becoming more open to the idea of divorce as they seek greater autonomy and independence."
