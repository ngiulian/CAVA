                "content": "Seniors in Latvia face several challenges, including financial difficulties, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with low pensions and rising living costs, making it challenging to meet their basic needs. Access to quality healthcare services can be limited, especially in rural areas, leading to difficulties in receiving timely and appropriate medical care. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and societal attitudes can hinder seniors' ability to find work or participate fully in society."
