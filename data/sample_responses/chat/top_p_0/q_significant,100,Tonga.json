In 1970, Tonga gained independence from British colonial rule and adopted a new constitution, establishing itself as a sovereign nation. This event marked a significant shift in Tonga's governance and set the foundation for its modern political system. Prior to this, Tonga had been a British protectorate since 1900. The transition to a constitutional monarchy allowed for greater political participation and representation for the Tongan people."
