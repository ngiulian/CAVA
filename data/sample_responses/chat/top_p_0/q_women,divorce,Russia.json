                "content": "Most women in Russia have mixed opinions about divorce. While some view it as a necessary step to escape an unhappy or abusive marriage, others see it as a failure and a source of shame. Divorce is generally more accepted in urban areas, where women have greater independence and access to support networks. However, in more traditional and conservative regions, divorce is often stigmatized, and women may face social judgment and difficulties in finding new partners. Overall, attitudes towards divorce among Russian women vary depending on factors such as age, education, cultural background, and personal experiences."
