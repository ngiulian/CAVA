However, it is worth noting that Gabon has relatively liberal laws regarding abortion compared to some other African countries. In Gabon, abortion is legal in cases of rape, incest, fetal malformation, and when the mother's life is at risk. \n\nWhile some women in Gabon may support the right to access safe and legal abortions, others may hold more conservative views due to cultural, religious, or personal beliefs. These differing opinions can be influenced by factors such as education, socioeconomic status, and exposure to different perspectives. It is important to recognize that women's opinions on abortion can be diverse and should be respected, as this is a complex and sensitive issue."
