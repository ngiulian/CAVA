Women's perspectives on divorce in Colombia, as in any other country, depend on various factors such as personal experiences, cultural background, education, and socio-economic status. While some women may view divorce as a necessary step to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others may prioritize maintaining the family unit and may be more hesitant to consider divorce. It is important to recognize that women's opinions on divorce are diverse and cannot be generalized for an entire population."
