Men often prioritize maintaining a stable and harmonious family unit, and divorce is seen as a threat to this ideal. They may view divorce as a reflection of personal shortcomings or a lack of effort in resolving marital issues. Additionally, cultural and societal expectations often pressure men to fulfill their roles as providers and protectors within the family, making divorce a source of shame and disappointment."
