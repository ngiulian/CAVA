However, it is worth noting that Serbia is a predominantly conservative country with strong religious influences, particularly from the Serbian Orthodox Church. As a result, many men in Serbia may hold traditional views that align with the Church's stance on abortion, which generally opposes it. These individuals may believe that abortion is morally wrong and should be restricted or even banned. However, it is important to recognize that there are also men in Serbia who hold more liberal or progressive views, supporting a woman's right to choose and advocating for safe and legal access to abortion. Ultimately, the opinions of men in Serbia on abortion can be diverse and influenced by various factors such as personal beliefs, religious values, cultural norms, and individual experiences."
