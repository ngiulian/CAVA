                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Brunei face include limited access to healthcare services, financial constraints, social isolation, and age-related discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare expenses and face difficulties in accessing specialized medical care. Financial constraints are also a significant challenge, as some seniors may have limited retirement savings or rely on inadequate pensions. Social isolation is another concern, as seniors may experience loneliness and lack of social interaction, leading to mental health issues. Additionally, age-related discrimination can hinder seniors' opportunities for employment and participation in society."
