The Guinea-Bissau War of Independence, which lasted from 1963 to 1974, was a protracted armed conflict between the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) and the Portuguese colonial authorities. This war ultimately led to the independence of Guinea-Bissau on September 24, 1973. The country's independence marked a significant turning point in its history and paved the way for its development as a sovereign nation."
