The cost of living is also a significant challenge, with rising prices for housing, education, healthcare, and basic necessities. Inequality and poverty persist, with a significant wealth gap between the rich and the poor. Access to quality healthcare and education is limited in some areas, particularly in rural regions. Additionally, there are concerns about crime rates and safety, as well as environmental issues such as pollution and climate change."
