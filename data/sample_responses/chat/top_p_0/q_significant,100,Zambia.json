On October 24, 1964, Zambia gained independence and became a sovereign nation. This event marked a turning point in the country's history, as it ended decades of British colonialism and paved the way for self-governance and the establishment of a new nation. The independence movement was led by Kenneth Kaunda, who became Zambia's first president. This event not only shaped Zambia's political landscape but also had a profound impact on its social, economic, and cultural development."
