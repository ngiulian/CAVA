However, Norway is known for its progressive stance on reproductive rights, including abortion. The majority of men in Norway support a woman's right to choose and believe that decisions regarding pregnancy should be made by the woman herself. They generally respect women's autonomy and advocate for access to safe and legal abortion services."
