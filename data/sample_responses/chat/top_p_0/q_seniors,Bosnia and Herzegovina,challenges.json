                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Bosnia and Herzegovina face include limited access to healthcare services, inadequate pension benefits, high poverty rates, social isolation, and discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford necessary medical treatments and medications due to the high cost of healthcare services. Additionally, pension benefits are often insufficient to cover basic living expenses, leading to financial difficulties for seniors. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as many seniors lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Lastly, discrimination against seniors, particularly in employment and housing, further exacerbates their challenges and limits their opportunities for a dignified and fulfilling life."
