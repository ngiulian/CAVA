Walking: If the weather is pleasant and you enjoy walking, you can simply walk to the grocery store. It will take you approximately 10-15 minutes to cover a distance of 1km on foot.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle or can rent one, cycling is another convenient option. Latvia has well-maintained cycling paths in many areas, making it safe and efficient to travel short distances. Cycling to the grocery store would take you around 5-7 minutes.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Depending on the location and availability of public transportation, you can check if there are any buses or trams that pass near the grocery store. You can use public transportation apps or websites to find the most suitable route and schedule.\n\n4. Taxi or Rideshare: If you prefer a more comfortable and convenient option, you can consider taking a taxi or using a rideshare service like Uber or Bolt. These services are widely available in Latvia, and the short distance to the grocery store should make the fare affordable.\n\nRemember to consider factors such as weather conditions, personal preferences, and the availability of transportation options when deciding how to get to the grocery store."
