                "content": "Most women in Kenya have mixed opinions about divorce. While some view it as a necessary step to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others consider it a last resort due to societal and cultural pressures. Many women believe that divorce brings shame and stigma, affecting their reputation and social standing. Financial concerns also play a significant role, as women fear the economic instability that often accompanies divorce. However, there is a growing trend of women advocating for their rights and seeking divorce as a means to achieve personal happiness and empowerment. Overall, the perception of divorce among women in Kenya is complex, influenced by cultural norms, personal circumstances, and evolving attitudes towards gender equality."
