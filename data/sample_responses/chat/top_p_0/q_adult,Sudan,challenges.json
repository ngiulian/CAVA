                "content": "Adults in Sudan face several significant challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the ongoing political instability and conflict in the country, which has resulted in economic hardships, displacement, and limited access to basic services such as healthcare and education. The high levels of poverty and unemployment further exacerbate these challenges, making it difficult for adults to provide for themselves and their families. Additionally, Sudan faces environmental challenges such as droughts and desertification, which impact agriculture and food security. Gender inequality and limited access to women's rights and opportunities also pose significant challenges for adult women in Sudan."
