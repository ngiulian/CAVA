This event marked a turning point in the country's history and had a profound impact on its political landscape. The Arab Spring protests in Algeria were part of a larger wave of demonstrations across the Arab world, demanding political reforms, social justice, and an end to corruption. The protests in Algeria led to the ousting of long-time President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in 2019, who had been in power for 20 years. This event sparked a period of political transition and ongoing protests, shaping the country's trajectory in the past two decades."
