Walking: If the weather is pleasant and you enjoy walking, you can simply walk to the grocery store. It will take approximately 10-15 minutes to cover a distance of 1km on foot.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle or can rent one, cycling can be a convenient and faster option. It will take around 3-5 minutes to reach the store by bike.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Check if there are any local buses or minibusses that pass by or near the grocery store. You can inquire about the nearest bus stop and take a bus to reach your destination.\n\n4. Taxi: Taxis are readily available in Swaziland, and you can easily find one to take you to the grocery store. It might be a bit more expensive than other options, but it offers convenience and saves time.\n\nConsider choosing the mode of transportation that suits your preferences, budget, and the local conditions."
