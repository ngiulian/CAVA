                "content": "Most women in Laos have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view divorce as a last resort and believe that it should only be considered in extreme circumstances. Women in Laos prioritize maintaining the stability and harmony of their families and communities, and divorce is seen as a disruption to this ideal. They often feel societal pressure to stay in unhappy marriages for the sake of their children, their reputation, and to avoid being stigmatized by their communities. Additionally, financial dependence on their husbands and limited legal rights further discourage women from seeking divorce. Overall, most women in Laos have a conservative attitude towards divorce and prefer to endure difficult marriages rather than pursue separation."
