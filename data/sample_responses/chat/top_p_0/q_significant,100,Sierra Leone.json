This brutal conflict had a profound impact on the country, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives, displacement of millions, and widespread destruction of infrastructure. The war was characterized by atrocities, including widespread use of child soldiers, amputations, and sexual violence. It also involved the intervention of international peacekeeping forces, such as the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). The civil war had long-lasting consequences for Sierra Leone, including political instability, economic decline, and social divisions."
