This revolution led to the overthrow of President Askar Akayev, who had been in power since the country gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The revolution was sparked by allegations of corruption, authoritarianism, and fraudulent parliamentary elections. It resulted in a change of government and the establishment of a more democratic system in Kyrgyzstan. The Tulip Revolution had a profound impact on the country's political landscape and set the stage for subsequent political developments in the years to come."
