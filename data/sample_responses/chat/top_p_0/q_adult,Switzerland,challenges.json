The country's competitive job market and high expectations for qualifications can also pose challenges for adults seeking employment or career advancement. Additionally, balancing work and personal life can be demanding, as Switzerland has a strong work culture and long working hours. The high level of stress and pressure in the workplace can impact mental health and overall well-being. Finally, navigating the complex healthcare system and managing healthcare costs can be a challenge for adults in Switzerland."
