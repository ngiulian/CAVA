                "content": "Most men in Kuwait generally have negative views towards divorce. They consider divorce as a last resort and believe that it should only be pursued in extreme cases where there is no possibility of reconciliation. Men often perceive divorce as a failure and a disruption to the traditional family structure. They prioritize maintaining the stability of the family unit and preserving societal norms and values. Additionally, men in Kuwait may face societal pressure and judgment if they initiate or support divorce, as it is often seen as a reflection of their inability to fulfill their role as a husband and provider."
