However, it can be generally said that attitudes towards divorce have been evolving in recent years. While divorce was once stigmatized and frowned upon, many women in Mauritius now view it as a viable option to escape unhappy or abusive marriages. Women are increasingly seeking independence, empowerment, and the right to make choices that prioritize their well-being and happiness. However, it is important to note that cultural, religious, and societal factors can still influence individual perspectives on divorce in Mauritius."
