They often view it as a failure and a source of shame, believing that it reflects poorly on their ability to maintain a successful marriage. Men in Lithuania tend to prioritize the preservation of their family unit and traditional values, valuing stability and commitment in relationships. Divorce is generally seen as a last resort, with many men preferring to work through marital issues and find solutions rather than opting for separation."
