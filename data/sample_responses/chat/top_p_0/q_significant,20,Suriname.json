Bouterse, who had previously ruled Suriname as a military dictator, was found guilty in 2019 of ordering the execution of 15 political opponents during his regime. This event marked a significant moment in Suriname's history, as it brought some measure of justice for the victims and their families, and highlighted the importance of accountability and human rights in the country."
