                "content": "Seniors in Morocco face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare and social services, financial difficulties, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare and medications, especially those living in rural areas with limited healthcare facilities. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive social security systems often leaves seniors financially vulnerable, particularly if they have no pension or savings. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Lastly, age discrimination is prevalent in various aspects of life, including employment, housing, and healthcare, which further exacerbates the challenges faced by seniors in Morocco."
