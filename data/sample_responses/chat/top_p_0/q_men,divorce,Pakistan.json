They often consider divorce as a socially stigmatized and undesirable outcome, preferring to prioritize the preservation of the marital bond. Traditional gender roles and societal expectations often influence their perspective, leading them to view divorce as a disruption to family values and social norms. However, it is important to note that perspectives on divorce can vary among individuals based on their personal beliefs, education, and exposure to different cultural influences."
