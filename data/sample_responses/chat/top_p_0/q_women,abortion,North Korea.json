                "content": "It is challenging to provide an accurate summary of what most women in North Korea think of abortion, as the country's government tightly controls information and restricts freedom of expression. However, it is known that North Korea has strict laws regarding abortion, and the government promotes a pro-natalist policy, encouraging population growth. Abortions are generally only permitted in cases of severe health risks to the mother or fetus. Therefore, it can be inferred that most women in North Korea may view abortion negatively due to legal restrictions and societal pressures to have children. However, without comprehensive data or individual perspectives, it is difficult to ascertain the exact opinions of women in North Korea on this matter."
