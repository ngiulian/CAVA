                "content": "Most men in Russia have a generally negative view of abortion. They believe that it is morally wrong and should be avoided as a means of birth control. Many men consider abortion to be a form of killing and believe that it goes against their religious or cultural values. They often perceive it as a responsibility of women to prevent unwanted pregnancies and view abortion as a consequence of women's irresponsibility or promiscuity. However, it is important to note that opinions on abortion can vary among individuals, and there are also men in Russia who support a woman's right to choose and believe in reproductive freedom."
