                "content": "Most men in India hold conservative views on divorce and generally perceive it as a negative and undesirable outcome. They often consider divorce as a social stigma and believe that it disrupts the traditional family structure and societal norms. Men in India typically prioritize maintaining the sanctity of marriage and family unity, valuing the concept of lifelong commitment. Divorce is often seen as a last resort, with men preferring to resolve marital issues through compromise, mediation, or seeking support from family and friends. However, it is important to note that attitudes towards divorce can vary among individuals based on factors such as education, urbanization, and exposure to different cultural influences."
