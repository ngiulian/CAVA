Cameroon gained independence on January 1, 1960, from France, and on October 1, 1961, British Cameroon joined to form a unified, independent nation. This event marked a crucial turning point in the country's history, leading to the establishment of a sovereign state and the beginning of self-governance for the Cameroonian people."
