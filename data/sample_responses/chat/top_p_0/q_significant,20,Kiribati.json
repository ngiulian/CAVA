This declaration highlighted the urgent threat of climate change to the low-lying island nation and called for global action to mitigate its impacts. Kiribati, being one of the countries most vulnerable to rising sea levels, has been at the forefront of advocating for climate change awareness and adaptation measures. The declaration brought international attention to the plight of Kiribati and other Pacific Island nations facing similar challenges, emphasizing the need for immediate action to address climate change."
