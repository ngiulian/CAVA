Multiple coordinated suicide bombings targeted churches and luxury hotels across the country, resulting in the deaths of over 250 people and injuring hundreds more. This event had a profound impact on Sri Lanka, leading to increased security measures, religious tensions, and a significant blow to the country's tourism industry."
