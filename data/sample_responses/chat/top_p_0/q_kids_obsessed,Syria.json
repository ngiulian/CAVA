However, like kids in many other parts of the world, Syrian children may be interested in popular culture, technology, social media, sports, music, fashion, and video games. Additionally, due to the ongoing conflict and its impact on their lives, some Syrian children may also be preoccupied with survival, education, and rebuilding their communities."
