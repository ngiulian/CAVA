                "content": "Most men in Saudi Arabia hold conservative views on abortion, considering it morally wrong and against Islamic teachings. They generally believe that life begins at conception and that terminating a pregnancy is equivalent to taking a human life. Consequently, they oppose abortion except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. Men in Saudi Arabia often prioritize the preservation of the unborn child's life and advocate for alternative solutions such as adoption or supporting pregnant women in difficult situations."
