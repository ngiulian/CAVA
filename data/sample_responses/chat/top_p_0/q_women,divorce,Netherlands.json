They view it as a viable option to end an unhappy or dysfunctional marriage, prioritizing personal happiness and fulfillment. Women in the Netherlands generally believe in the importance of individual autonomy and personal growth, which influences their perception of divorce. They often consider divorce as a means to escape an unhealthy relationship and seek a better future for themselves and their children. Additionally, Dutch women tend to have a strong support system, including friends, family, and social services, which further encourages them to pursue divorce if necessary. Overall, divorce is seen as a socially acceptable and legitimate choice for women in the Netherlands, allowing them to prioritize their own well-being and happiness."
