The country's economic situation often leads to financial difficulties for families, making it harder for teenagers to access quality education and secure stable employment prospects. Additionally, substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drug addiction, is a prevalent issue among teenagers. Mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are also on the rise, with limited access to mental health services exacerbating the situation. Lastly, social inequality persists, with marginalized groups facing discrimination and limited opportunities for social mobility."
