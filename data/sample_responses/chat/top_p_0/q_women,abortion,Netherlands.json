However, the Netherlands is known for its progressive stance on reproductive rights, including abortion. Abortion is legal and accessible in the country, and most women in the Netherlands support a woman's right to choose. They believe that women should have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health. The majority of women in the Netherlands value the availability of safe and legal abortion services, and they believe in the importance of comprehensive sexual education and access to contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies."
