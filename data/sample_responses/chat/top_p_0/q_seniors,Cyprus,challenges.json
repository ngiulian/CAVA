                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Cyprus face include financial difficulties, healthcare issues, social isolation, and limited access to support services. Many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions and rising living costs, making it challenging to meet their basic needs. Healthcare concerns arise due to age-related illnesses and limited access to specialized medical care. Social isolation is a significant issue as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, leading to loneliness and mental health problems. Additionally, limited availability of support services, such as home care and transportation, further exacerbates the challenges faced by seniors in Cyprus."
