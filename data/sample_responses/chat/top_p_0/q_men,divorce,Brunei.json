Men in Brunei tend to prioritize maintaining a stable and harmonious family unit, valuing the preservation of marriage and the well-being of children. Divorce is often seen as a social taboo, and men may feel societal pressure to stay in unhappy marriages for the sake of societal expectations and cultural norms."
