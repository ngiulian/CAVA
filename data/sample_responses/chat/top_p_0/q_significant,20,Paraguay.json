Lugo, a former Catholic bishop, was accused of mishandling a land dispute that resulted in violent clashes between police and landless peasants. The Paraguayan Congress impeached him, citing his \"poor performance\" and \"malfeasance in office.\" This event led to political instability and controversy within the country, as well as international criticism of the impeachment process."
