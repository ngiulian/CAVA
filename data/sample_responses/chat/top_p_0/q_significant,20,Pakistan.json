Bhutto, a prominent political figure and the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan, was assassinated during a political rally in Rawalpindi. Her death had a profound impact on the country's political landscape, leading to widespread protests, political instability, and a subsequent investigation into her assassination. The event marked a turning point in Pakistan's history and had far-reaching consequences for its political and social dynamics."
