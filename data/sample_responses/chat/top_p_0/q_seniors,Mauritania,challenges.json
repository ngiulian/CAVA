                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Mauritania face include limited access to healthcare, poverty and financial insecurity, social isolation, and inadequate support systems. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, leading to untreated health conditions. Poverty and financial insecurity are prevalent among seniors, as they often lack sufficient retirement savings or pensions. This makes it difficult for them to meet their basic needs and access essential services. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, leading to loneliness and mental health issues. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive support systems and programs specifically designed to address the needs of seniors in Mauritania."
