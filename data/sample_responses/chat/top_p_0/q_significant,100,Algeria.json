This conflict was a protracted struggle between the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) and the French colonial forces. The war resulted in the independence of Algeria from French rule and marked a turning point in the decolonization process in Africa. It had a profound impact on Algerian society, politics, and culture, shaping the country's identity and its subsequent path as an independent nation."
