Women in France generally believe that divorce provides them with the opportunity to pursue personal happiness and independence. They often view divorce as a means to escape from abusive or unfulfilling relationships, and they prioritize their own well-being and self-fulfillment. Additionally, French women tend to have a pragmatic approach towards divorce, focusing on the practical aspects such as financial stability and child custody arrangements. Overall, divorce is seen as a socially acceptable and empowering choice for women in France."
