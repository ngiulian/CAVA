                "content": "Most men in Poland have varying opinions about divorce. Some men view divorce as a necessary solution to an unhappy or dysfunctional marriage, believing that it can provide a chance for personal growth and a fresh start. They may see divorce as a way to escape an abusive or unfulfilling relationship, prioritizing their own well-being and happiness. However, there are also men who hold more traditional views and perceive divorce as a failure or a betrayal of family values. They may feel a sense of shame or disappointment associated with divorce, particularly if it involves children. These men may prioritize maintaining the stability of the family unit and may be more inclined to work on their marriage rather than seeking a divorce. Overall, the attitudes towards divorce among men in Poland can vary depending on personal beliefs, values, and individual experiences."
