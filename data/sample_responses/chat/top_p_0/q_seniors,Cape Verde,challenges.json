                "content": "Seniors in Cape Verde face several challenges. Firstly, healthcare is a major concern as access to quality medical facilities and services is limited, especially in rural areas. Many seniors struggle with chronic diseases and lack proper healthcare support. Secondly, poverty and financial insecurity are prevalent among seniors, particularly those who have retired without sufficient savings or pensions. This leads to difficulties in meeting basic needs and accessing essential services. Additionally, social isolation is a significant challenge for seniors, as they often lack social networks and opportunities for engagement, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Lastly, age discrimination and limited employment opportunities pose obstacles for seniors who wish to remain active and financially independent."
