                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Estonia face include social isolation, limited access to healthcare services, financial difficulties, and age discrimination. Many seniors in Estonia live alone or in remote areas, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation. Additionally, there is a shortage of healthcare professionals and facilities in rural areas, making it difficult for seniors to access necessary medical care. Financial difficulties are also common among seniors, especially those who rely solely on pensions, as the cost of living continues to rise. Lastly, age discrimination is a concern, as seniors may face stereotypes or prejudices that limit their opportunities for employment or social participation."
