                "content": "Most men in Oman hold negative views towards divorce. They generally consider divorce as a last resort and believe that it should be avoided if possible. Men in Oman often prioritize maintaining a stable and harmonious family life, valuing the preservation of marriage and the well-being of their children. Divorce is seen as a disruption to societal norms and traditional values, and it is generally perceived as a failure or a sign of personal weakness. Men in Oman tend to view divorce as a source of shame and stigma, both for themselves and their families. However, it is important to note that individual opinions may vary, and there may be some men in Oman who have more progressive or accepting views towards divorce."
