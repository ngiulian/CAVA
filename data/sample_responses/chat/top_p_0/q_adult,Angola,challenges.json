The country has a history of civil war and corruption, which has hindered economic development and created significant social disparities. Additionally, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has had a devastating impact on the population, leading to health issues and increased vulnerability. Overall, these challenges make it difficult for adults in Angola to secure stable employment, access essential services, and improve their living conditions."
