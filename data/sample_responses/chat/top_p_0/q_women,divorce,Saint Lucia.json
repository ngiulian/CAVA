However, it is generally observed that attitudes towards divorce have evolved over time. While some women may still hold traditional views that discourage divorce and prioritize maintaining the sanctity of marriage, there is a growing acceptance and understanding of the need for divorce in certain circumstances. Many women recognize that divorce can be a necessary step to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, and they prioritize their own well-being and that of their children. Additionally, societal changes, increased education, and exposure to different cultural influences have contributed to a more open-minded approach towards divorce among women in Saint Lucia."
