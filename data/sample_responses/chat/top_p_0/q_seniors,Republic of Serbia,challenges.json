                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in the Republic of Serbia face include financial difficulties, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with low pensions and inadequate financial support, making it challenging to meet their basic needs and afford healthcare expenses. Additionally, the healthcare system often lacks specialized services for seniors, leading to difficulties in accessing appropriate medical care. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, which can negatively impact their mental and physical well-being. Lastly, age discrimination is prevalent in various aspects of life, including employment, housing, and public services, making it harder for seniors to fully participate in society and enjoy their rights."
