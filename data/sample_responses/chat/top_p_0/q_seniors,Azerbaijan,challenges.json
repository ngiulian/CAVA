                "content": "Seniors in Azerbaijan face several challenges, including financial difficulties, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions and rising living costs, making it challenging for them to meet their basic needs. Access to quality healthcare is often limited, especially in rural areas, leading to difficulties in receiving proper medical treatment. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and societal attitudes can hinder seniors' ability to participate fully in society and access various services and opportunities."
