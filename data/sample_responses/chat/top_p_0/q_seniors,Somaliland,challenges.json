                "content": "Seniors in Somaliland face several significant challenges. Firstly, healthcare is a major concern as access to quality medical services and facilities is limited, especially in rural areas. Many seniors struggle with chronic illnesses and lack proper healthcare support.\n\nSecondly, poverty and financial insecurity are prevalent among seniors. A significant portion of the elderly population in Somaliland lives in poverty, lacking sufficient income or retirement benefits. This makes it difficult for them to meet their basic needs and afford essential expenses such as food, housing, and healthcare.\n\nThirdly, social isolation and neglect are common challenges for seniors. Due to cultural norms and changing family structures, many elderly individuals experience loneliness and neglect, with limited social interactions and support networks. This can have detrimental effects on their mental and emotional well-being.\n\nLastly, illiteracy and limited access to education pose challenges for seniors in Somaliland. Many older individuals did not have the opportunity to receive formal education during their youth, which hinders their ability to adapt to modern technologies and access information and resources.\n\nOverall, addressing healthcare disparities, poverty, social isolation, and promoting education and social inclusion are crucial in improving the lives of seniors in Somaliland."
