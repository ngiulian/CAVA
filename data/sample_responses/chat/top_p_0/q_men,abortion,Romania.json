However, in Romania, a predominantly conservative country with strong religious influences, there is a significant portion of the male population that holds conservative views on abortion. Many men in Romania, particularly those who adhere to traditional values and religious beliefs, tend to oppose abortion and consider it morally wrong. They may view it as the termination of a potential life and believe that it goes against their religious or ethical principles. However, it is crucial to recognize that there are also men in Romania who support a woman's right to choose and believe in the importance of reproductive rights and autonomy."
