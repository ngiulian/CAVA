                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Iceland face include social isolation, limited access to healthcare services, financial difficulties, and ageism. Social isolation is a significant concern as many seniors live alone and may lack social connections, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Limited access to healthcare services, especially in rural areas, can make it difficult for seniors to receive timely and adequate medical care. Financial difficulties can arise due to pension inadequacy or high living costs, making it challenging for seniors to meet their basic needs. Lastly, ageism, or discrimination based on age, can lead to exclusion from employment opportunities and societal marginalization, impacting seniors' overall well-being."
