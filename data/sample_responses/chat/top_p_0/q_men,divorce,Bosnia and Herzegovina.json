                "content": "Most men in Bosnia and Herzegovina have a negative perception of divorce. They often view it as a failure and a source of shame, believing that it goes against traditional family values and societal norms. Divorce is generally seen as a last resort, and men may feel a sense of disappointment and loss when their marriage ends. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, especially among younger generations, as they become more open to the idea of ending an unhappy marriage and prioritizing personal happiness and well-being."
