Walking: Finland has well-maintained sidewalks and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, so walking is a convenient and eco-friendly option. It should take you around 10-15 minutes to cover a 1km distance on foot.\n\n2. Cycling: Finland has an extensive network of cycling paths, making it a popular mode of transportation. If you have a bicycle, you can easily reach the grocery store within a few minutes.\n\n3. Public transportation: Depending on your location and the availability of public transportation, you can check for bus or tram routes that pass near the grocery store. Use the local transport app or website to find the most suitable route and schedule.\n\n4. Car: If you have access to a car, driving to the grocery store is another option. However, keep in mind that a 1km distance is relatively short, and parking might be limited or expensive near the store.\n\nConsider the weather conditions, your personal preferences, and the availability of transportation options to choose the most suitable method for your trip to the grocery store."
