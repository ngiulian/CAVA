                "content": "Most men in Equatorial Guinea hold negative views towards divorce. They generally perceive divorce as a failure and a disruption to the traditional family structure. Men often prioritize maintaining the stability of the family unit and preserving their social status within the community. Divorce is seen as a source of shame and embarrassment, reflecting poorly on a man's ability to fulfill his role as a husband and father. Consequently, men in Equatorial Guinea tend to discourage divorce and may exert pressure on their wives to remain in unhappy marriages."
