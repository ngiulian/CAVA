The expansion project, which began in 2007 and was completed in 2016, involved the construction of a new set of locks that allowed larger ships to transit through the canal. This expansion has had a significant impact on global trade, as it increased the canal's capacity and efficiency, enabling the passage of larger vessels and facilitating trade between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The expanded canal has also brought economic benefits to Panama, attracting increased shipping traffic and generating revenue for the country."
