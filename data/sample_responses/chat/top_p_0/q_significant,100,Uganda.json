                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Uganda in the past 100 years is the overthrow of President Idi Amin's regime in 1979. Idi Amin, who ruled Uganda from 1971 to 1979, was known for his brutal and oppressive regime, characterized by human rights abuses, political repression, and economic mismanagement. His regime was responsible for the deaths of an estimated 300,000 people.\n\nIn 1979, a coalition of Ugandan exiles, backed by Tanzanian forces, launched a military campaign to overthrow Amin. This led to the fall of his regime and the end of his brutal rule. The overthrow of Idi Amin's regime marked a significant turning point in Uganda's history, bringing an end to a period of violence and instability.\n\nFollowing Amin's ousting, Uganda underwent a series of political transitions and conflicts, but the overthrow of his regime remains a pivotal event in the country's recent history. It opened the door for subsequent political developments, including the rise of President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986."
