                "content": "Most women in Bangladesh have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a last resort and believe that it should only be considered in extreme circumstances. Women often prioritize maintaining the stability of their families and upholding societal norms and values. Divorce is seen as a failure and can carry social stigma, leading many women to endure unhappy marriages rather than seeking separation. Additionally, financial dependence, lack of legal support, and fear of losing custody of their children further discourage women from pursuing divorce."
