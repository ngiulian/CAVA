The conflict erupted when Houthi rebels, a Shia minority group, took control of the capital city, Sana'a, and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to flee the country. This led to a military intervention by a Saudi-led coalition in support of the Yemeni government. The war has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis, with thousands of deaths, widespread famine, and the displacement of millions of Yemenis. It is considered one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters."
