                "content": "Most women in Eritrea have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a last resort and believe that it should only be considered in extreme circumstances. Women in Eritrea prioritize maintaining the stability of their families and communities, and divorce is often seen as a disruption to this harmony. They may feel societal pressure to stay in unhappy marriages for the sake of their children or to avoid being stigmatized by their communities. Additionally, financial dependence on their husbands and limited legal rights may also contribute to their reluctance to pursue divorce."
