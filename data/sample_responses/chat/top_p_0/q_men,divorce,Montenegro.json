                "content": "Most men in Montenegro have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a failure and a source of shame, believing that it reflects poorly on their masculinity and ability to maintain a stable family. Divorce is often seen as a last resort, with men preferring to endure unhappy marriages rather than face the social stigma associated with divorce. Additionally, many men in Montenegro hold traditional values that prioritize the preservation of the family unit, making divorce less socially acceptable."
