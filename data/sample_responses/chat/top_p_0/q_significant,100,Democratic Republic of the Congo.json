The Congo Crisis was a period of political upheaval and conflict that took place from 1960 to 1965, following the country's independence from Belgium.\n\nAfter gaining independence, the DRC faced numerous challenges, including political instability, regional secessionist movements, and foreign interference. The crisis escalated when the Congolese Prime Minister, Patrice Lumumba, was overthrown and subsequently assassinated in 1961. This event led to a power struggle between various factions, including the central government, regional leaders, and foreign powers.\n\nThe crisis further intensified when the mineral-rich province of Katanga declared independence under the leadership of Moise Tshombe. This sparked a series of conflicts, involving the Congolese army, UN peacekeeping forces, and mercenaries hired by foreign interests. The crisis also witnessed the involvement of neighboring countries, such as Belgium, the United States, and the Soviet Union, who supported different factions for their own strategic interests.\n\nThe Congo Crisis resulted in widespread violence, political instability, and economic disruption. It also highlighted the exploitation of the DRC's resources by foreign powers and the complex dynamics of post-colonial African politics. The crisis eventually ended in 1965 when the Congolese army, with the support of UN forces, defeated the secessionist movements and regained control over the country.\n\nThe Congo"
