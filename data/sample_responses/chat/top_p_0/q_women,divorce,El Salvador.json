                "content": "Most women in El Salvador have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women believe that divorce is a necessary option to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others view it as a social taboo and believe that marriage should be a lifelong commitment. The perception of divorce is often influenced by cultural and religious beliefs, as well as societal pressure to maintain traditional family structures. However, with changing attitudes and increasing awareness about women's rights, there is a growing acceptance of divorce as a means to seek personal happiness and freedom from unhealthy relationships."
