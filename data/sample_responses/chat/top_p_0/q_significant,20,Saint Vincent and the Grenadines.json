This eruption was the first major eruption of the volcano since 1979 and had a significant impact on the island and its inhabitants. The eruption resulted in the evacuation of thousands of residents, the destruction of infrastructure, and the displacement of many people. It also caused ashfall and pyroclastic flows, leading to the loss of vegetation and agricultural damage. The eruption had long-lasting effects on the island's economy, environment, and social fabric, making it a significant event in recent history."
