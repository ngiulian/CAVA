                "content": "Most men in Greece have traditionally held negative views towards divorce. They often perceive divorce as a failure and a threat to the traditional family structure. Many men believe that divorce is a sign of weakness and a lack of commitment to the marriage. They may also view divorce as a disruption to social norms and religious values. However, it is important to note that attitudes towards divorce are evolving in Greece, and younger generations are generally more accepting of it."
