They generally view divorce as a failure and a source of shame, believing that it reflects poorly on their masculinity and ability to maintain a stable family. Men often prioritize the preservation of their marriage and family unit, considering divorce as a last resort. They may feel societal pressure to stay in unhappy marriages for the sake of their reputation and to avoid judgment from their community."
