                "content": "Most men in El Salvador hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is socially unacceptable and goes against traditional values and religious beliefs. Men often perceive divorce as a failure and a threat to the stability of the family unit. They may view divorce as a sign of weakness or lack of commitment, and may stigmatize individuals who choose to end their marriages. Additionally, men in El Salvador often prioritize the preservation of the family and the well-being of their children over personal happiness or fulfillment."
