Many seniors struggle to afford medical expenses and face difficulties in accessing quality healthcare services. Financial insecurity is a significant concern as a large portion of seniors live in poverty and lack sufficient retirement savings. Social isolation is prevalent due to changing family structures, migration, and urbanization, leading to a lack of emotional support and companionship. Additionally, there is a lack of dedicated support systems and programs specifically designed to address the needs of seniors in Bangladesh."
