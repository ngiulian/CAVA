                "content": "Most men in Sudan generally have a negative perception of divorce. They view it as a last resort and believe that it should only be considered in extreme cases. Men often prioritize maintaining the stability of the family unit and preserving societal norms and traditions. Divorce is seen as a failure and can carry a social stigma, particularly for women. Men in Sudan tend to value the concept of marriage and the responsibilities that come with it, and they may view divorce as a betrayal of those commitments."
