Emperor Akihito, who had been the emperor for 30 years, abdicated on April 30, 2019, due to his declining health. This marked the first abdication by a Japanese emperor in over two centuries. Emperor Naruhito ascended to the throne the following day, on May 1, 2019, beginning the Reiwa era. This event had significant cultural and historical importance for Japan."
