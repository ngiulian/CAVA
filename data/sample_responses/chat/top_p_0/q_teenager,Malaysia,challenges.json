                "content": "Teenagers in Malaysia face several significant challenges. One of the biggest challenges is academic pressure, as they are expected to excel in their studies and achieve high grades. This pressure often leads to stress, anxiety, and mental health issues. Additionally, teenagers in Malaysia also face challenges related to social media and technology, such as cyberbullying, online harassment, and addiction to social media platforms. Peer pressure is another challenge, as teenagers may feel compelled to conform to societal norms and engage in risky behaviors. Furthermore, cultural and religious expectations can create conflicts for teenagers, as they may struggle to balance traditional values with modern influences. Finally, economic challenges, such as unemployment and financial instability, can also impact teenagers in Malaysia, making it difficult for them to plan for their future and achieve their goals."
