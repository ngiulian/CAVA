However, there are some common perspectives that can be observed.\n\nIn general, divorce is still considered a taboo subject in Kashmiri society, and many women face significant social and cultural pressures to maintain their marriages. Traditional values and societal expectations often prioritize the preservation of the marital bond, and divorce is seen as a failure or a sign of personal weakness.\n\nHowever, there is a growing awareness and desire for change among some women in Kashmir. Many educated and empowered women are challenging the traditional norms and advocating for their rights, including the right to divorce. They believe that divorce can be a means to escape abusive or unhappy marriages and to seek personal freedom and happiness.\n\nAdditionally, some women view divorce as a way to challenge patriarchal structures and gender inequalities prevalent in Kashmiri society. They see it as a step towards asserting their independence and autonomy, and as a means to break free from oppressive marital relationships.\n\nOverall, while divorce is still stigmatized in Kashmir, there is a gradual shift in attitudes among some women who are seeking greater agency and empowerment in their lives. However, it is important to recognize that these perspectives may not be representative of all women in Kashmir, as individual experiences and circumstances can greatly influence their opinions on divorce."
