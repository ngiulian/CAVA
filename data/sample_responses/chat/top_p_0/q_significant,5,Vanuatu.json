Cyclone Pam was one of the strongest tropical cyclones to hit the Pacific region, causing widespread destruction and loss of life in Vanuatu. The cyclone resulted in the displacement of thousands of people, destruction of homes, infrastructure, and agricultural lands, and had a severe impact on the country's economy. The international community provided significant aid and support to help Vanuatu recover from the disaster."
