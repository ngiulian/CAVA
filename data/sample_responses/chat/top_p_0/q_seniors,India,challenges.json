                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in India face include financial insecurity, lack of healthcare access, social isolation, and age-related discrimination. Many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions or savings, making it difficult to meet their basic needs. Access to quality healthcare is often limited, especially in rural areas, leading to health issues and high medical expenses. Social isolation is a common problem as seniors may feel neglected or abandoned by their families, leading to loneliness and mental health issues. Additionally, age-related discrimination in employment and society can hinder seniors' opportunities and overall well-being."
