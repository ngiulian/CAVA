However, in the Czech Republic, abortion is legal and widely accepted. The majority of women in the country support a woman's right to choose and believe that access to safe and legal abortion is essential. They view it as a personal decision that should be made by the woman, in consultation with her doctor, without interference from the state or society. The Czech Republic has a progressive stance on reproductive rights, and women generally have access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare services, including abortion."
