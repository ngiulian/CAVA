                "content": "Seniors in Moldova face several significant challenges. Firstly, there is a lack of adequate healthcare services and facilities, leading to difficulties in accessing quality medical care. Many seniors also struggle with financial insecurity, as pensions are often insufficient to cover basic needs. This is exacerbated by high inflation rates and limited job opportunities for older individuals. Additionally, social isolation and loneliness are prevalent issues, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for engagement. Lastly, there is a lack of age-friendly infrastructure and services, making it challenging for seniors to navigate their communities and access necessary resources."
