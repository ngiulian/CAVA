This tragic event, carried out by a Norwegian right-wing extremist named Anders Behring Breivik, involved a bombing in Oslo and a mass shooting on the island of Ut\u00f8ya. A total of 77 people were killed, mostly young people attending a summer camp organized by the Norwegian Labour Party's youth organization. This event had a profound impact on Norway, leading to discussions on security, extremism, and the country's values of openness and tolerance."
