However, based on general observations and cultural factors, it can be said that most women in Brunei tend to hold conservative views on abortion.\n\nBrunei is an Islamic country where the majority of the population follows Sharia law, which heavily influences societal norms and values. Islam generally considers abortion to be morally wrong, except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. Consequently, many women in Brunei adhere to these religious beliefs and consider abortion to be unacceptable.\n\nMoreover, Brunei is a close-knit society with strong family values, where the concept of preserving life and protecting the family unit is highly valued. This cultural context further contributes to the prevailing conservative stance on abortion among women in Brunei.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that individual opinions may differ, and there may be some women in Brunei who hold more liberal views on abortion. These views could be influenced by personal experiences, exposure to different perspectives, or a more secular outlook."
