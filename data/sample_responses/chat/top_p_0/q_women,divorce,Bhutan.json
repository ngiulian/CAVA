                "content": "Most women in Bhutan have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a last resort and believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment. Divorce is often seen as a failure and brings social stigma, particularly for women. Women may feel pressured to stay in unhappy marriages due to societal expectations, cultural norms, and fear of judgment from their families and communities. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, especially among younger generations who are more open to the idea of ending an unhappy marriage."
