The ECCC was established in 2006 to prosecute the senior leaders and those most responsible for the atrocities committed during the Khmer Rouge regime from 1975 to 1979. This period saw the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million people through execution, forced labor, and starvation.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge Tribunal aimed to bring justice and accountability for the crimes committed during this dark period of Cambodian history. It has been instrumental in documenting the atrocities, providing a platform for survivors to share their stories, and holding individuals accountable for their actions. The trials have shed light on the horrors of the past and helped in the healing process for many Cambodians.\n\nThe ECCC has faced numerous challenges, including funding issues, political interference, and the advanced age of the defendants. However, it has successfully completed several trials, including the conviction of Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Duch, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng prison. The tribunal has played a crucial role in addressing the crimes committed during the Khmer Rouge era and promoting justice and reconciliation in Cambodia."
