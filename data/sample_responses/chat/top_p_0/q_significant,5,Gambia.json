After 22 years of authoritarian rule under President Yahya Jammeh, the country held presidential elections in December 2016. Adama Barrow, the opposition candidate, won the election, but Jammeh initially refused to step down. However, through regional diplomatic efforts and the threat of military intervention by neighboring countries, Jammeh eventually relinquished power and went into exile. This event marked a significant turning point for The Gambia, as it demonstrated the possibility of democratic change and brought hope for a new era of governance and human rights in the country."
