                "content": "Most women in South Sudan hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is a last resort and should only be considered in extreme circumstances. Women often perceive divorce as a failure and a source of shame within their communities. They prioritize maintaining the stability of their families and the well-being of their children over personal happiness or fulfillment. Additionally, societal and cultural norms, as well as religious beliefs, often discourage divorce and place a significant burden on women to endure difficult marriages."
