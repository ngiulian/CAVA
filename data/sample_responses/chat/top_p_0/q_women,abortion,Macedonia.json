However, it is known that abortion is a highly debated and sensitive topic in the country. Macedonia has a predominantly conservative society, influenced by religious and cultural beliefs. As a result, many women in Macedonia may hold conservative views on abortion, considering it morally wrong and against their religious or cultural values. However, there are also women who support a woman's right to choose and believe in the importance of reproductive rights and access to safe and legal abortion. Overall, the opinions on abortion among women in Macedonia are diverse and can be influenced by personal, religious, cultural, and societal factors."
