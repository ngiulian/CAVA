However, it is worth noting that the Republic of Congo is a predominantly Christian country, with Catholicism being the largest religious group. Catholic teachings generally oppose abortion, considering it as the termination of a human life. Therefore, it is likely that many Congolese men, particularly those who adhere to Catholic beliefs, may hold negative views towards abortion. However, it is important to recognize that there are diverse perspectives on this issue, and some men in the Republic of Congo may have different opinions based on personal, cultural, or religious beliefs."
