Many seniors in Oman suffer from chronic diseases and require specialized healthcare, which may be expensive and inaccessible. Financial constraints are also a concern as pensions and retirement savings may not be sufficient to cover their needs. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may feel lonely and disconnected from their families and communities. Additionally, limited access to support services such as transportation, caregiving, and recreational activities further exacerbate the difficulties faced by seniors in Oman."
