Public opinion on abortion in Grenada is influenced by a combination of factors, including cultural, religious, and personal beliefs. Some men may hold conservative views and oppose abortion, considering it morally wrong and against their religious or cultural values. Others may have more liberal perspectives, supporting a woman's right to choose and considering abortion as a personal decision. It is important to note that individual opinions on abortion can differ significantly, and it is not possible to generalize the views of an entire population."
