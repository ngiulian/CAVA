Walking: If the weather is pleasant and you enjoy walking, you can simply walk to the grocery store. It will take you approximately 10-15 minutes to cover a distance of 1km.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle or can rent one, cycling can be a convenient and quick way to reach the grocery store. It will take you around 5-10 minutes to cover the distance.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Check if there are any local buses or minibusses that pass by or near the grocery store. You can inquire about the bus routes and schedules at the nearest bus station or ask locals for assistance.\n\n4. Taxi: If you prefer a more comfortable and direct option, you can take a taxi to the grocery store. Taxis are usually readily available in Montenegro, and the ride should be relatively short and affordable.\n\nConsider choosing the mode of transportation that suits your preferences, the weather conditions, and the availability of resources."
