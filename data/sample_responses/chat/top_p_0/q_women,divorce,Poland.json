                "content": "Most women in Poland have a negative perception of divorce. They often view it as a last resort and believe that marriage should be a lifelong commitment. Women in Poland tend to prioritize family values and traditional gender roles, which can contribute to their reluctance towards divorce. They may also fear the social stigma and potential negative consequences associated with divorce, such as financial instability or difficulties in raising children alone. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually changing, especially among younger generations, as they become more open to the idea of ending an unhappy or abusive marriage."
