                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Mongolia face include limited access to healthcare services, inadequate social support systems, poverty and financial insecurity, and a lack of opportunities for active aging. The country's healthcare system is often under-resourced, making it difficult for seniors to receive proper medical care and support. Additionally, there is a lack of social support networks, such as community centers or organizations, that can provide assistance and companionship to seniors. Many seniors in Mongolia also struggle with poverty and financial insecurity, as they may not have sufficient retirement savings or access to pension benefits. Finally, there is a lack of opportunities for active aging, such as recreational activities or employment options, which can lead to social isolation and a decline in overall well-being."
