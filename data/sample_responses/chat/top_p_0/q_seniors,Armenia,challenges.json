                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Armenia face include limited access to healthcare services, financial difficulties, social isolation, and inadequate pension benefits. Many seniors struggle to afford necessary medical treatments and medications due to the high cost of healthcare. Additionally, a significant portion of the elderly population in Armenia lives in poverty, making it difficult for them to meet their basic needs and maintain a decent standard of living. Social isolation is another challenge as seniors often lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Furthermore, the pension system in Armenia is often criticized for providing insufficient benefits, leaving many seniors financially vulnerable and dependent on their families for support."
