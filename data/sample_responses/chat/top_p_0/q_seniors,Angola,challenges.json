Many seniors struggle to afford medical treatment and face difficulties accessing healthcare facilities, especially in rural areas. Poverty is a significant issue, with a large portion of seniors living in poverty and lacking basic necessities. Additionally, the social security system in Angola is insufficient, leaving many seniors without a stable income or financial support. Lastly, there is a lack of support systems for seniors, including limited availability of elderly care facilities and a lack of programs addressing their specific needs."
