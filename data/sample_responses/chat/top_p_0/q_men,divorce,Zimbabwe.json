                "content": "Most men in Zimbabwe hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is a sign of failure and a breakdown of the family unit. Men often perceive divorce as a threat to their social status and masculinity, as it may be seen as a reflection of their inability to maintain a stable marriage. Additionally, divorce is often associated with financial burdens, such as the division of assets and potential alimony payments, which further discourages men from considering it as a viable option. Consequently, many men in Zimbabwe tend to prioritize preserving their marriages and finding ways to resolve conflicts rather than pursuing divorce."
