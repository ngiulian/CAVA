However, in Nepal, where cultural, religious, and social factors influence perspectives on abortion, there are some common beliefs and attitudes that can be observed.\n\nMany men in Nepal hold conservative views on abortion due to the influence of traditional values, religious beliefs, and societal norms. In this context, abortion is often seen as morally wrong and against the sanctity of life. Some men may consider it a sin or immoral act, as it goes against their religious teachings or cultural practices.\n\nHowever, it is also worth mentioning that there are men who support a woman's right to choose and believe in reproductive rights. These individuals may prioritize a woman's autonomy and bodily autonomy, recognizing that she should have the right to make decisions about her own reproductive health.\n\nOverall, while there is a significant portion of men in Nepal who hold conservative views on abortion, it is important to acknowledge that opinions can vary greatly depending on factors such as education, exposure to different perspectives, and personal beliefs."
