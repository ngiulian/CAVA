The country's economy has been struggling, leading to financial instability for many adults. Additionally, corruption and bureaucracy hinder business growth and discourage foreign investments. Access to quality healthcare and education is also a challenge, with limited resources and outdated infrastructure. Furthermore, emigration has become a significant issue, as many adults, especially young professionals, leave the country in search of better opportunities abroad."
