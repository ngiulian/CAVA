This event marked the end of Mongolia's communist regime and the beginning of a multi-party democracy. On December 10, 1990, after weeks of protests and demonstrations, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) agreed to end one-party rule and allow political pluralism. This transition to democracy brought about significant changes in Mongolia's political, social, and economic landscape, leading to increased freedoms, human rights, and market-oriented reforms. It also opened up Mongolia to the global community and paved the way for its economic development and integration into the international arena."
