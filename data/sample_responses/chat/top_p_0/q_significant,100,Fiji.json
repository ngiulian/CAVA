                "content": "One of the most significant events that occurred in Fiji in the past 100 years was the military coup in 1987. On May 14, 1987, the first coup took place when Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka led a group of soldiers to overthrow the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra. This event marked the beginning of a series of political upheavals and coups that had a profound impact on Fiji's political landscape.\n\nThe 1987 coup was primarily motivated by ethnic tensions between the indigenous Fijians and the Indo-Fijians, who were descendants of Indian laborers brought to Fiji during British colonial rule. The coup resulted in the establishment of an interim military government, which led to the adoption of a new constitution that favored indigenous Fijians and marginalized the Indo-Fijian population.\n\nThis event had far-reaching consequences for Fiji's political stability, economy, and social fabric. It led to a significant increase in ethnic tensions, political instability, and a decline in investor confidence. The subsequent coups in 2000 and 2006 further exacerbated these issues, leading to a cycle of political instability and economic challenges.\n\nWhile Fiji has made progress towards political stability and reconciliation in recent years, the 1987 coup remains a significant event that shaped the country's history and continues to influence its socio-political dynamics."
