Carlos Alvarado Quesada, a center-left candidate, won the election and became the President of Costa Rica. This election was notable because it marked a shift in the country's political landscape, with Alvarado Quesada's victory seen as a rejection of traditional politics and a desire for progressive change. Additionally, Alvarado Quesada's presidency has been characterized by a focus on environmental issues, LGBTQ+ rights, and social justice, making it a significant event in Costa Rican politics."
