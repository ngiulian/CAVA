After years of civil war, clan conflicts, and the collapse of the central government in 1991, Somalia experienced a period of statelessness and instability. However, in 2012, a new federal government was formed, marking a significant step towards stability and governance in the country. This event brought hope for a more unified and functional Somalia, although challenges and conflicts still persist."
