Additionally, there are concerns about political instability, corruption, and limited opportunities for career growth. The country's heavy reliance on tourism also makes the economy vulnerable to external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has severely impacted the livelihoods of many adults in Maldives."
