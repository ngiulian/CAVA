On December 28, a group of armed men led by a former military officer attempted to overthrow President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo's government. The coup attempt was quickly foiled by the security forces, resulting in a series of arrests and trials. This event had a significant impact on the political stability of Equatorial Guinea and highlighted ongoing tensions within the country."
