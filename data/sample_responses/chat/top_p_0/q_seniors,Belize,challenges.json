Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare and face difficulties in accessing medical facilities, especially in rural areas. Financial insecurity is a significant concern, as a significant portion of seniors live in poverty and lack sufficient retirement savings. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors often experience loneliness and lack opportunities for social engagement. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive support systems and programs specifically designed to address the needs of seniors in Belize."
