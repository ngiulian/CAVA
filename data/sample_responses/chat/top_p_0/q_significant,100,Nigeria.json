This event marked the end of over six decades of British control and the beginning of Nigeria's journey as an independent nation. It had a profound impact on the country's political, social, and economic landscape, shaping its future trajectory. Nigeria's independence also inspired other African nations in their struggle for self-determination and decolonization."
