                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Mauritius face include financial insecurity, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions and lack of savings, making it difficult to meet their basic needs and afford healthcare expenses. Access to quality healthcare services is often limited, especially in rural areas, leading to health issues going untreated. Social isolation is a common problem as seniors may feel disconnected from their families and communities, leading to loneliness and mental health issues. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and societal attitudes can hinder seniors from actively participating in society and accessing opportunities."
