                "content": "Teenagers in Sri Lanka face several significant challenges. One major challenge is the pressure to excel academically, as education is highly valued in Sri Lankan society. This can lead to intense competition, stress, and mental health issues among teenagers. Additionally, limited access to quality education and resources in rural areas can hinder their educational opportunities.\n\nAnother challenge is the lack of employment opportunities for teenagers, especially in rural areas. This can lead to frustration, financial difficulties, and a sense of hopelessness among young people. Poverty and inequality also contribute to these challenges, as some teenagers struggle to meet their basic needs.\n\nTeenagers in Sri Lanka also face social and cultural challenges. Traditional gender roles and societal expectations can limit their freedom and opportunities, particularly for girls. Issues such as early marriage, gender-based violence, and discrimination persist, affecting their overall well-being.\n\nFurthermore, the influence of technology and social media poses challenges such as cyberbullying, online harassment, and addiction. The rapid pace of technological advancements can also create a generation gap and difficulties in adapting to the digital world.\n\nLastly, the impact of natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, can disrupt the lives of teenagers, leading to displacement, trauma, and loss of educational opportunities.\n\nOverall, the challenges faced by teenagers in Sri Lanka encompass academic pressure, limited employment opportunities, poverty, gender inequality, social expectations, technological influences, and the impact of natural disasters."
