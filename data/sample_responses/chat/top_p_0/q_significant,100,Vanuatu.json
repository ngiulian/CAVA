This eruption forced the entire population of the island, approximately 11,000 people, to be evacuated. It was the largest evacuation in the country's history and had a significant impact on the affected communities. The eruption caused widespread destruction, including the destruction of crops, infrastructure, and homes, leading to long-term displacement and challenges for the affected population. The event highlighted the vulnerability of Vanuatu to natural disasters and the need for preparedness and resilience in the face of such events."
