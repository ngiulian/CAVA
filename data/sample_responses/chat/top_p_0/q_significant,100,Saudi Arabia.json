This discovery occurred in 1938, when oil was found in the eastern region of the country. The subsequent development of the oil industry transformed Saudi Arabia from a predominantly agrarian society into one of the world's leading oil producers and exporters. The revenue generated from oil exports has had a profound impact on the country's economy, infrastructure, and social development. It has also played a crucial role in shaping Saudi Arabia's geopolitical influence on the global stage."
