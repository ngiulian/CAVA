The GST is a comprehensive indirect tax reform that replaced multiple state and central taxes, unifying the Indian market and creating a single tax structure across the country. This event has had a profound impact on India's economy, simplifying the tax system, promoting ease of doing business, and fostering economic integration. The implementation of GST has been considered a landmark reform in India's economic history."
