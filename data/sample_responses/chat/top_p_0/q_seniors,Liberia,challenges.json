Many seniors struggle to afford medical treatment and medications due to the high cost of healthcare services. Poverty is prevalent among seniors, as they often lack sufficient income and struggle to meet their basic needs. Additionally, there is a lack of social support systems, such as community centers or programs, which can lead to isolation and loneliness. Lastly, the pension systems in Liberia are often inadequate, leaving many seniors without a reliable source of income during their retirement years."
