In August 2017, violence erupted in Myanmar's Rakhine state, leading to a mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution and seeking refuge in neighboring Bangladesh. Over 700,000 Rohingya refugees crossed the border into Bangladesh, joining the already existing refugee population. This influx of refugees created a humanitarian crisis, straining resources and infrastructure in the country. The Rohingya crisis has had a profound impact on Bangladesh, both socially and economically, as the country continues to provide shelter and support to the displaced Rohingya population."
