                "content": "Teenagers in Cuba face several significant challenges. One of the biggest challenges is limited access to information and technology due to government restrictions. Internet access is expensive and heavily regulated, making it difficult for teenagers to stay connected and access educational resources.\n\nAnother challenge is the lack of economic opportunities. Cuba's centrally planned economy limits job prospects for teenagers, leading to high unemployment rates. This can result in frustration and a sense of hopelessness among young people.\n\nAdditionally, the education system in Cuba is highly focused on academic achievements, which can create pressure and stress for teenagers. The curriculum often lacks practical skills and vocational training, limiting their options for future careers.\n\nFurthermore, the limited freedom of expression and political repression in Cuba can be challenging for teenagers. They may face restrictions on their ability to express themselves freely, participate in political activities, or voice their opinions.\n\nLastly, the scarcity of basic goods and services, including food and healthcare, can also impact teenagers' well-being and quality of life. Limited access to essential resources can lead to difficulties in meeting their basic needs and hinder their overall development."
