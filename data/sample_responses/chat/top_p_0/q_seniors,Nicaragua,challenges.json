                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Nicaragua face include limited access to healthcare, financial insecurity, social isolation, and inadequate support systems. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, leading to untreated medical conditions. Financial insecurity is prevalent among seniors due to low pensions and limited job opportunities, making it difficult for them to meet their basic needs. Social isolation is a significant challenge as seniors often lack social connections and face neglect or abandonment. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive support systems and programs specifically designed to address the needs of seniors in Nicaragua."
