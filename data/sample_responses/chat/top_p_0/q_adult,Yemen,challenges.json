This conflict has resulted in widespread violence, displacement, and a severe humanitarian crisis. The war has led to the destruction of infrastructure, including healthcare facilities, leaving many adults without access to essential services. The economy has also been severely impacted, leading to high unemployment rates and limited job opportunities. Additionally, the lack of basic necessities such as food, clean water, and sanitation facilities further exacerbates the challenges faced by adults in Yemen. The war has also disrupted education, leaving many adults without access to quality learning opportunities. Overall, the conflict has created a complex and multifaceted crisis, making life extremely difficult for adults in Yemen."
