It marked a significant shift in the country's political landscape as the pro-Russian Harmony party, which had been the largest party in the previous parliament, was surpassed by the newly formed center-right party, New Unity. This election result brought about a change in government and signaled a shift towards a more pro-European Union and pro-NATO stance in Latvian politics."
