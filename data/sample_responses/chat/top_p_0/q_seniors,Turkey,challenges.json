                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Turkey face include financial difficulties, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and inadequate support systems. Many seniors struggle with low pensions and rising living costs, making it challenging to meet their basic needs. Additionally, healthcare services may be insufficient or inaccessible, especially in rural areas, leading to difficulties in receiving proper medical care. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors often lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. Lastly, there is a lack of comprehensive support systems and programs specifically designed to address the unique needs of seniors, further exacerbating their challenges."
