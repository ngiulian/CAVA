However, it is known that Liberia is a predominantly Christian country, and religious beliefs often influence attitudes towards abortion. Many women in Liberia hold conservative views on abortion, considering it morally wrong and against their religious beliefs. They may view it as a violation of the sanctity of life and believe that it should only be considered in cases where the mother's life is at risk. However, it is essential to recognize that there may be diverse opinions and perspectives on this topic among women in Liberia."
