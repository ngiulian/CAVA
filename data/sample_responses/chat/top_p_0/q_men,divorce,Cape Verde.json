                "content": "Most men in Cape Verde have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a failure and a disruption to the traditional family structure. They believe that divorce brings shame and stigma to both the individuals involved and their families. Men often prioritize maintaining a stable and harmonious family life, and divorce is seen as a threat to this ideal. Consequently, they tend to discourage divorce and emphasize the importance of commitment and perseverance in marriage."
