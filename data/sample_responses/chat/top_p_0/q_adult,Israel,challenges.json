Many struggle to afford housing, healthcare, and education. Additionally, there are security concerns due to the ongoing conflict in the region, which can impact daily life and mental well-being. Other challenges include political polarization, social divisions, and limited job opportunities, particularly for certain minority groups. Access to affordable childcare and work-life balance are also significant challenges for many adults in Israel."
