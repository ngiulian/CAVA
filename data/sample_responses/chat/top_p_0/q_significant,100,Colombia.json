This agreement ended a 52-year-long armed conflict, making it the longest-running conflict in the Americas. The peace deal aimed to address issues of land reform, political participation, drug trafficking, and the rights of victims. It was a significant milestone in Colombia's history, bringing hope for a more peaceful and prosperous future for the country."
