                "content": "Most women in Mexico have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women view divorce as a necessary step to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others may feel societal pressure to stay in their marriages for the sake of their children or due to cultural and religious beliefs. Additionally, financial dependence on their spouses and fear of social stigma can also influence women's attitudes towards divorce. Overall, the perception of divorce among women in Mexico varies depending on individual circumstances and cultural factors."
