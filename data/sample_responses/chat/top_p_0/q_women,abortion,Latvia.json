However, it is known that Latvia has a relatively conservative society, and there are mixed opinions on the topic of abortion. Some women in Latvia may hold traditional or religious beliefs that consider abortion morally wrong and may oppose it. On the other hand, there are also women who support a woman's right to choose and believe that access to safe and legal abortion is essential for women's reproductive rights and autonomy. Ultimately, the views on abortion among women in Latvia can be diverse and influenced by personal, cultural, and religious factors."
