This election resulted in a shift in power, as the center-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) emerged as the largest party, winning 25 out of 90 seats in the National Assembly. This marked a change from the previous center-left government led by the Modern Centre Party (SMC). The election also saw the rise of several new parties, including the anti-immigration Slovenian National Party (SNS) and the left-wing Levica party. This event had a significant impact on the political landscape of Slovenia and set the stage for subsequent developments in the country."
