However, it is worth noting that Finland has a generally progressive and liberal attitude towards reproductive rights, including abortion. The country's legislation allows for legal and accessible abortion services, and public opinion surveys suggest that a majority of Finns support a woman's right to choose. Nevertheless, there may be diverse opinions among men in Finland, ranging from those who strongly support a woman's right to make decisions about her own body to those who may hold more conservative views."
