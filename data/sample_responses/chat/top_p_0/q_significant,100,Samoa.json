This event marked a major milestone in the country's history and had a profound impact on its governance, culture, and identity.\n\nIn 1914, Samoa was divided between Germany and the United States as a result of the Tripartite Convention. However, during World War I, New Zealand forces occupied German Samoa in 1914 and continued to administer the territory under a League of Nations mandate until 1962.\n\nThe most significant turning point came on January 1, 1962, when Samoa gained its independence from New Zealand. This event, known as \"Independence Day,\" marked the end of colonial rule and the establishment of the Independent State of Samoa. It allowed the Samoan people to govern themselves and shape their own destiny.\n\nThe transition to independence brought about various changes, including the adoption of a new constitution, the establishment of a parliamentary democracy, and the reassertion of Samoan cultural values and traditions. It also led to the country's recognition on the international stage as a sovereign nation.\n\nOverall, the achievement of independence stands as a pivotal event in Samoa's recent history, shaping its political, social, and cultural landscape over the past century."
