                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Lesotho face include limited access to healthcare, poverty and financial insecurity, social isolation, and lack of support systems. Many seniors in Lesotho struggle to access adequate healthcare due to limited resources and infrastructure, leading to higher rates of chronic diseases and limited access to medications. Poverty and financial insecurity are prevalent among seniors, as they often lack sufficient pensions or social security benefits, making it difficult to meet their basic needs. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may face loneliness and lack of social interaction, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. Additionally, the lack of support systems and services specifically tailored to seniors further exacerbates these challenges."
