In 2017, negotiations were held in an attempt to find a solution to the long-standing division of the island. The talks, facilitated by the United Nations, aimed to create a federal solution that would reunify Cyprus as a bi-communal and bi-zonal federation. However, despite several rounds of negotiations, the talks ultimately collapsed in 2017, and no agreement was reached. This event had significant implications for the future of Cyprus and its ongoing efforts towards reunification."
