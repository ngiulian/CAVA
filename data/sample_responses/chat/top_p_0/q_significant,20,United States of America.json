However, one event that had a profound impact on the country and the world was the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The coordinated attacks by the extremist group Al-Qaeda resulted in the destruction of the World Trade Center towers in New York City, significant damage to the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people lost their lives in these attacks, making it one of the deadliest acts of terrorism in history. The event led to significant changes in U.S. foreign policy, the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, and the initiation of the War on Terror. It also had a lasting impact on American society, including increased security measures, changes in air travel regulations, and a heightened sense of national security."
