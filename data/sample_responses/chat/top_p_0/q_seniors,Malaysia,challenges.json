                "content": "Seniors in Malaysia face several challenges, including financial difficulties, healthcare issues, social isolation, and limited access to technology. Many seniors struggle with inadequate retirement savings and rely on limited government assistance, making it challenging for them to meet their basic needs. Healthcare can be expensive, and seniors often face difficulties in accessing quality medical care and affordable medications. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may feel lonely and disconnected from their communities, leading to mental health issues. Additionally, limited access to technology and digital literacy skills can hinder seniors' ability to stay connected, access information, and participate in the digital economy."
