This peaceful revolution led to the overthrow of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia and marked the end of 41 years of communist rule. The Velvet Revolution played a crucial role in the country's transition to democracy and paved the way for the subsequent split of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993."
