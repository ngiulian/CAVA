On January 1, 1984, Brunei gained full sovereignty and became an independent nation. This event marked a crucial milestone in Brunei's history, as it allowed the country to establish its own government and shape its own destiny. Brunei's independence has since played a vital role in shaping its political, economic, and social development."
