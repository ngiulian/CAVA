They believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and divorce is seen as a failure or a disgrace. Men often prioritize maintaining family harmony and societal reputation over individual happiness or personal conflicts. Divorce is considered a last resort and is often stigmatized, leading men to discourage or resist the idea of divorce."
