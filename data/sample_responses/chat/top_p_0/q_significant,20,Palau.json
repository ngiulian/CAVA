This initiative aimed to protect and conserve Palau's rich marine resources by creating one of the world's largest marine protected areas (MPAs). The PNMS covers an area of 500,000 square kilometers, which is roughly 80% of Palau's exclusive economic zone. It prohibits all commercial fishing activities within its boundaries, allowing only sustainable domestic fishing for local consumption. This landmark decision demonstrated Palau's commitment to environmental conservation and sustainable management of its natural resources, setting an example for other nations to follow in marine conservation efforts."
