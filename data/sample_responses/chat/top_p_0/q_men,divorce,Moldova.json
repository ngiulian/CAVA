                "content": "Most men in Moldova have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a failure and a source of shame, believing that it reflects poorly on their ability to maintain a successful marriage. Men often prioritize the preservation of the family unit and traditional gender roles, where the husband is the breadwinner and the wife takes care of the household and children. Divorce is seen as a disruption to this idealized family structure, and men may feel a sense of loss, disappointment, and societal judgment if their marriage ends in divorce."
