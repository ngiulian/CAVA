                "content": "Most men in Latvia have a negative perception of divorce. They often view it as a failure and a source of shame, as it goes against traditional family values and societal norms. Men tend to prioritize maintaining a stable and intact family unit, and divorce is seen as a disruption to this ideal. Additionally, there may be concerns about financial implications and the impact on children. Overall, divorce is generally perceived as a last resort and not a desirable outcome among men in Latvia."
