The healthcare system in Palau is limited, and seniors often struggle to access quality medical care, especially in remote areas. Financial insecurity is another significant challenge, as many seniors rely on limited pensions or have inadequate savings to meet their needs. Social isolation is a common issue, as seniors may live alone or have limited social interactions, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Additionally, Palau lacks specialized care facilities for seniors, such as nursing homes or assisted living centers, making it difficult for those with complex medical needs to receive appropriate care."
