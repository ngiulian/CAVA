The education system in Albania often lacks resources and quality, making it difficult for teenagers to receive a well-rounded education. Additionally, the high unemployment rates in the country make it challenging for teenagers to find job opportunities and secure financial stability. Social pressures, such as peer pressure and societal expectations, can also impact teenagers' mental health and well-being. Furthermore, access to healthcare and mental health services is often limited, leaving teenagers with inadequate support for their physical and mental health needs."
