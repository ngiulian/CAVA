                "content": "Most women in Cambodia have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a last resort and believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment. Divorce is often stigmatized in Cambodian society, and women may face social judgment and discrimination if they choose to end their marriage. Additionally, many women rely on their husbands for financial support and fear the economic consequences of divorce. Consequently, most women in Cambodia are hesitant to pursue divorce and prefer to endure unhappy marriages rather than face the societal and economic challenges associated with separation."
