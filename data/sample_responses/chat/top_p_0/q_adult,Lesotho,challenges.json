The country has a high poverty rate, with many adults struggling to meet their basic needs and provide for their families. Unemployment is also a significant issue, with limited job opportunities and a large informal sector. Access to quality education and healthcare is limited, particularly in rural areas, leading to lower literacy rates and inadequate healthcare services. Food insecurity is prevalent, with a significant portion of the population experiencing hunger and malnutrition. Additionally, Lesotho has one of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates globally, which poses significant health and socio-economic challenges for adults in the country."
