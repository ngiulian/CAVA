Additionally, corruption and political instability pose significant challenges to the country's economic growth and development. The cost of living is also a concern, as many struggle to afford basic necessities. Furthermore, discrimination and social exclusion based on factors such as race, gender, and sexual orientation continue to be prevalent issues in Brazilian society."
