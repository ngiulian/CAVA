                "content": "Most women in Sweden have a positive and accepting attitude towards divorce. They view it as a viable option to end an unhappy or dysfunctional marriage, and believe that individuals should have the freedom to pursue personal happiness and fulfillment. Swedish women generally prioritize their own well-being and independence, and divorce is seen as a means to achieve that. They also value gender equality and believe that both partners should have equal rights and responsibilities within a marriage. Consequently, women in Sweden tend to support divorce as a way to break free from oppressive or unequal relationships."
