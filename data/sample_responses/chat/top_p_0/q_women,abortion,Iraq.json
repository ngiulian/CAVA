However, it is generally observed that abortion is a highly sensitive and controversial topic in Iraq.\n\nMany women in Iraq, particularly those who adhere to conservative religious beliefs, view abortion as morally wrong and unacceptable. They believe that life begins at conception and that terminating a pregnancy is equivalent to taking a human life, which goes against their religious teachings and values. These women often prioritize the preservation of the unborn child's life and consider abortion as a sin.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also women in Iraq who support a woman's right to choose and believe that abortion should be legally accessible. These women argue that women should have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies, especially in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is at risk. They advocate for safe and legal abortion services to protect women's health and well-being.\n\nIt is important to recognize that due to the conservative nature of Iraqi society, discussions around abortion are often limited, and there may be a lack of open dialogue on the topic. Consequently, it is challenging to generalize the views of most women in Iraq regarding abortion, as opinions can vary significantly based on individual beliefs and circumstances."
