Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, leading to untreated medical conditions. Financial insecurity is prevalent among seniors due to limited pension benefits and lack of employment opportunities. Social isolation is a significant challenge as seniors often lack social connections and face neglect or abandonment. Additionally, there is a lack of support systems and specialized care facilities for seniors, making it difficult for them to receive the necessary assistance and care."
