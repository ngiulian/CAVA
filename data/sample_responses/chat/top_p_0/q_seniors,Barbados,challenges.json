                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Barbados face include limited access to healthcare services, financial constraints, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford necessary medical treatments and medications due to the high cost of healthcare. Additionally, financial constraints often arise from inadequate pension plans and limited employment opportunities for seniors. Social isolation is another significant challenge as seniors may experience loneliness and lack of social support, especially if they live alone or have limited mobility. Lastly, age discrimination can hinder seniors' ability to find employment or access certain services, leading to further financial and social difficulties."
