Following the controversial presidential election held in October 2019, widespread protests erupted across the country, alleging electoral fraud and demanding the resignation of then-President Evo Morales. The crisis escalated, leading to Morales' resignation and subsequent exile. This event marked a significant shift in Bolivia's political landscape, with an interim government taking charge until new elections were held in October 2020. The crisis highlighted deep divisions within Bolivian society and had a profound impact on the country's political and social dynamics."
