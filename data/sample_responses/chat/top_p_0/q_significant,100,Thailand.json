This event marked the transition of Thailand from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy. On June 24, 1932, a group of military and civilian officials, known as the People's Party, staged a bloodless coup and demanded political reforms. As a result, King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) was forced to grant a constitution, establishing a constitutional monarchy and ending centuries of absolute rule by the monarchy. This event had a profound impact on Thai politics and society, shaping the country's political landscape for years to come."
