This event had a profound impact on the country's political, social, and economic landscape. The military coup overthrew the democratically elected government, leading to a repressive regime characterized by censorship, human rights abuses, and economic policies favoring the elite. The dictatorship ended in 1985 with the return of civilian rule, marking a significant turning point in Brazil's history."
