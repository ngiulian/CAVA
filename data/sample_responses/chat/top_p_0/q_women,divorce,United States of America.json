While some may view it as a necessary step to escape an unhappy or abusive marriage, others may see it as a last resort and a failure of their relationship. Many women believe that divorce can provide them with the opportunity to start afresh, regain their independence, and prioritize their own happiness. However, there are also women who may fear the financial and emotional consequences of divorce, especially if they have children or lack financial stability. Overall, women's perspectives on divorce in the United States are diverse and influenced by personal experiences, cultural norms, and individual beliefs."
