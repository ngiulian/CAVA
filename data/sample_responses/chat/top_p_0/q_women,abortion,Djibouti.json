However, based on general observations and cultural factors, it can be said that the majority of women in Djibouti hold conservative views on abortion.\n\nDjibouti is a predominantly Muslim country, and Islam generally considers abortion to be forbidden except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. Consequently, many women in Djibouti adhere to these religious beliefs and consider abortion to be morally wrong.\n\nFurthermore, Djibouti is a patriarchal society where traditional gender roles are prevalent. Women often face societal pressure to conform to societal expectations, including the expectation to bear children. Consequently, many women in Djibouti may view abortion as a violation of their role as mothers and may prioritize the preservation of life over personal choice.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that individual opinions on abortion can differ, and there may be women in Djibouti who hold more liberal views on the matter. Factors such as education, exposure to different perspectives, and personal experiences can influence individual opinions on abortion."
