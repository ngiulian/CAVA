                "content": "Most men in Benin have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view it as a failure and a disruption to the traditional family structure. Divorce is often seen as a last resort and is stigmatized in the society. Men tend to prioritize maintaining the unity of the family and preserving their reputation within the community. They may perceive divorce as a loss of control and authority over their household, as well as a potential financial burden. Consequently, many men in Benin strive to resolve marital issues through mediation, counseling, or other means to avoid divorce."
