                "content": "Seniors in Lithuania face several challenges, including financial difficulties, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with low pensions and rising living costs, making it difficult to meet their basic needs. Additionally, the healthcare system may not adequately address their specific needs, leading to limited access to quality medical care. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, which can negatively impact their mental and physical well-being. Lastly, age discrimination is prevalent in various aspects of life, including employment, housing, and public services, making it harder for seniors to fully participate in society."
