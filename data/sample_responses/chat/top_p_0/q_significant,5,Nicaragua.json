                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Nicaragua in the past 5 years was the outbreak of widespread protests and subsequent government crackdown in 2018. The protests initially began in April 2018 against proposed social security reforms but quickly escalated into a broader movement against President Daniel Ortega's government. The protests were met with a violent response from security forces, leading to numerous deaths, injuries, and human rights abuses. The government's crackdown on dissent resulted in a significant erosion of democratic institutions and civil liberties in the country."
