The education system in Luxembourg is highly competitive, leading to high expectations and stress among teenagers to perform well academically. This pressure can contribute to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. Peer pressure is also a common challenge, as teenagers may feel compelled to conform to certain behaviors or engage in risky activities to fit in. Substance abuse, including alcohol and drug use, is another concern among teenagers in Luxembourg. Additionally, the influence of social media can impact teenagers' self-esteem, body image, and overall mental well-being."
