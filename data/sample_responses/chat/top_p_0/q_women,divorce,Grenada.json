                "content": "Most women in Grenada have mixed opinions about divorce. Some women view divorce as a necessary option to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, while others believe in the sanctity of marriage and see divorce as a last resort. The perception of divorce also varies depending on cultural and religious beliefs. Some women may face societal pressure to stay in a marriage for the sake of their children or due to the stigma associated with divorce. However, there is a growing acceptance of divorce as women become more empowered and independent, seeking to prioritize their own happiness and well-being."
