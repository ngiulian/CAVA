Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare and face difficulties in accessing medical facilities, especially in rural areas. Financial insecurity is a significant concern, as pensions and retirement savings may not be sufficient to cover basic needs. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Additionally, age discrimination can lead to limited employment opportunities and exclusion from certain activities or services."
