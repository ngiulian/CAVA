                "content": "Most men in South Sudan hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is a shameful and dishonorable act that goes against cultural and religious values. Men often perceive divorce as a failure to maintain a stable and harmonious family, which is highly valued in their society. They consider divorce as a disruption to social order and a threat to the well-being of children. Consequently, men in South Sudan tend to discourage divorce and prioritize maintaining marital relationships, even in challenging circumstances."
