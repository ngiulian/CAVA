                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Lebanon in the past 100 years is the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990). The civil war was a complex conflict involving various factions, including political, religious, and ethnic groups, and it resulted in significant political, social, and economic consequences for the country.\n\nThe war was triggered by a combination of factors, including political and sectarian tensions, regional conflicts, and external interventions. It led to widespread violence, displacement of populations, and the destruction of infrastructure. The conflict also had a profound impact on Lebanon's demographics, with significant population shifts and changes in the balance of power among different communities.\n\nThe civil war had long-lasting effects on Lebanon's political system, as it resulted in the Taif Agreement in 1989, which restructured the country's political institutions and power-sharing arrangements. The war also left deep scars on Lebanese society, with divisions and traumas that continue to shape the country's dynamics.\n\nOverall, the Lebanese Civil War stands out as a significant event in Lebanon's recent history due to its duration, complexity, and the profound impact it had on the country's political, social, and economic landscape."
