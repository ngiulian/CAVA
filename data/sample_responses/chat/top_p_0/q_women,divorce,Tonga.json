                "content": "Most women in Tonga have a negative view of divorce. They generally believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and divorce is seen as a failure or a sign of weakness. Women in Tonga prioritize maintaining the family unit and preserving the social and cultural values associated with marriage. They often prioritize the well-being of their children and the stability of the family over personal happiness or individual desires. Consequently, divorce is generally discouraged and considered a last resort option for women in Tonga."
