On June 27, 1977, Djibouti gained independence after being a French colony for over a century. This event marked a crucial turning point in the country's history, as it allowed Djibouti to establish its own government and shape its own destiny. Independence brought about political, social, and economic changes, paving the way for Djibouti to become a sovereign nation."
