                "content": "Most women in Maldives have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women view divorce as a necessary option to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others believe that divorce is a last resort and should only be considered after exhausting all efforts to save the marriage. Additionally, societal and cultural factors, such as the stigma associated with divorce and the importance placed on maintaining family unity, can influence women's perspectives on divorce. Overall, the views on divorce among women in Maldives vary depending on individual circumstances and cultural beliefs."
