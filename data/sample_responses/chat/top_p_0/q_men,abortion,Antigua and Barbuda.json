However, it is worth noting that Antigua and Barbuda is a predominantly Christian country, and religious beliefs often influence attitudes towards abortion. Generally, conservative views prevail, and many men may hold pro-life perspectives, opposing abortion except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. However, it is important to recognize that there may be diverse opinions within the male population, and some individuals may hold more liberal or pro-choice views."
