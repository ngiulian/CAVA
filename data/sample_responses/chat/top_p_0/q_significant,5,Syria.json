The conflict started as a peaceful uprising against the government of President Bashar al-Assad but quickly escalated into a full-scale civil war. The war has resulted in immense human suffering, with hundreds of thousands of people killed and millions displaced from their homes. It has also drawn international attention and involvement, with various countries supporting different factions within Syria. The conflict has had far-reaching consequences, including the rise of extremist groups like ISIS, the displacement of millions of refugees, and the destruction of infrastructure and cities across the country."
