This event marked the beginning of a new era for Oman, as Sultan Qaboos implemented various reforms and modernization efforts that transformed the country. Under his leadership, Oman experienced significant advancements in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and economic development. Sultan Qaboos also played a crucial role in establishing diplomatic relations with other nations and promoting peace in the region. His reign lasted for almost 50 years until his death in 2020, making him the longest-serving ruler in the Middle East."
