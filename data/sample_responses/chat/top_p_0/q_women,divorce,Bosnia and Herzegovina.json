                "content": "Most women in Bosnia and Herzegovina have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women view divorce as a necessary step to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others believe in preserving the sanctity of marriage and see divorce as a last resort. Cultural and religious factors also play a significant role in shaping women's attitudes towards divorce, with some women feeling societal pressure to stay in unhappy marriages for the sake of their families or due to traditional values. Overall, there is no singular viewpoint among women in Bosnia and Herzegovina regarding divorce, as opinions vary based on individual experiences, beliefs, and circumstances."
