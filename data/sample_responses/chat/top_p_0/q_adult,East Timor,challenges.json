                "content": "Adults in East Timor face several significant challenges. One of the biggest challenges is poverty, as a large portion of the population lives below the poverty line. Limited access to education and healthcare services is another major issue, with many adults lacking basic literacy and struggling to access quality healthcare. Unemployment and underemployment rates are high, making it difficult for adults to secure stable and decent-paying jobs. Additionally, there is a lack of infrastructure and basic services in many areas, including clean water, electricity, and transportation, which further hampers the daily lives of adults. Political instability and corruption also pose challenges, hindering the development and progress of the country."
