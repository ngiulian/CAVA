On June 5, 2017, Montenegro officially became the 29th member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This marked a significant milestone for the country, as it became the first new member to join the alliance since 2009. Montenegro's NATO membership was seen as a step towards further integration with Euro-Atlantic institutions and a demonstration of its commitment to regional stability and security. The decision was not without controversy, as it sparked protests and political debates within the country. Nonetheless, Montenegro's NATO accession remains a significant event in its recent history."
