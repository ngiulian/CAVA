                "content": "Most women in Dominica have mixed opinions about divorce. Some women view divorce as a last resort and believe in working through marital issues to maintain the sanctity of marriage. They prioritize family unity and may be influenced by religious or cultural beliefs that discourage divorce. However, there is also a growing number of women who are more open to divorce, especially in cases of abuse, infidelity, or irreconcilable differences. These women prioritize their own well-being and may seek legal separation to escape unhealthy or unhappy marriages. Overall, attitudes towards divorce among women in Dominica vary depending on personal experiences, values, and societal influences."
