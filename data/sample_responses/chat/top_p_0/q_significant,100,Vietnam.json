The war had a profound impact on the country, its people, and the world. It resulted in the division of Vietnam into North and South, with the North being communist-led and the South being supported by the United States. The conflict caused immense suffering, loss of life, and displacement of millions of people. It also had far-reaching consequences, including the spread of anti-war movements globally and a shift in international relations. The Vietnam War remains a defining moment in Vietnam's history and continues to shape its socio-political landscape."
