The education system in Slovakia is highly competitive, and teenagers often face immense pressure to excel academically, leading to stress and anxiety. Additionally, the job market in Slovakia is relatively limited, making it difficult for teenagers to find employment and gain financial independence. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and tobacco, is a significant issue among Slovakian teenagers, leading to health problems and addiction. Mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, are also prevalent, with limited access to mental health services exacerbating the problem. Lastly, teenagers in Slovakia often face social pressures, including peer pressure, bullying, and societal expectations, which can negatively impact their self-esteem and overall well-being."
