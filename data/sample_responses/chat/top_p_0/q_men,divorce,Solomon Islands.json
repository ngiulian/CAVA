They generally believe that divorce is a shameful and dishonorable act that goes against their cultural and traditional values. Men in Solomon Islands prioritize maintaining strong family ties and view divorce as a failure to fulfill their responsibilities as husbands and fathers. They often perceive divorce as a disruption to social harmony and stability within their communities. Consequently, most men in Solomon Islands strive to resolve marital issues through reconciliation and compromise rather than opting for divorce."
