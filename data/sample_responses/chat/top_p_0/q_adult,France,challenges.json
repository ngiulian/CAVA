The cost of living, including housing, healthcare, and education, is also a significant challenge for many adults. Additionally, the French pension system is under strain, and there are concerns about the sustainability of retirement benefits. Other challenges include work-life balance, as long working hours and limited vacation time can impact personal well-being, and the need to adapt to technological advancements and changing job market demands."
