This summit marked the first time a North Korean leader had crossed the border into South Korea since the Korean War in the 1950s. The meeting resulted in the signing of the Panmunjom Declaration, which aimed to improve inter-Korean relations, work towards denuclearization, and establish a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. This event was seen as a major step towards reducing tensions and fostering dialogue between the two Koreas."
