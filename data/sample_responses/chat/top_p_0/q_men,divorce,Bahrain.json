Men in Bahrain tend to prioritize maintaining a stable and harmonious family life, and divorce is seen as a disruption to this ideal. They often perceive divorce as a failure and may feel societal pressure to keep their marriages intact. However, attitudes towards divorce may vary among individuals based on personal experiences, cultural background, and individual beliefs."
