                "content": "Seniors in Solomon Islands face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare services, poverty, inadequate social support, and a lack of opportunities for active aging. The country's healthcare system is often under-resourced and inaccessible in remote areas, making it difficult for seniors to receive proper medical care. Many seniors also struggle with poverty, as they may have limited income and rely on subsistence farming or informal employment. Additionally, there is a lack of social support systems, such as pensions or retirement benefits, leaving seniors vulnerable to financial insecurity. Lastly, opportunities for active aging, such as recreational activities or community engagement, are limited, leading to social isolation and a reduced quality of life for seniors in Solomon Islands."
