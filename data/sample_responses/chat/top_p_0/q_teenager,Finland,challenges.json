Academic pressure and stress related to school performance are also common challenges. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drug use, is another concern among Finnish teenagers. Additionally, social pressures, such as fitting in and peer pressure, can contribute to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem. Finally, the increasing use of technology and social media has brought about challenges related to cyberbullying and online harassment."
