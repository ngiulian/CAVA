                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Suriname face include limited access to healthcare, financial insecurity, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications due to limited financial resources. Additionally, a significant portion of the elderly population in Suriname lives in poverty, making it difficult for them to meet their basic needs. Social isolation is another challenge as seniors often lack social support networks and may feel lonely or neglected. Lastly, age discrimination is prevalent in Suriname, leading to limited employment opportunities and unequal treatment in various aspects of life."
