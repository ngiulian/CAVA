However, in general, the Maldivian society is predominantly Muslim, and Islam generally considers abortion to be prohibited except in certain circumstances. Therefore, many women in Maldives may hold conservative views on abortion and consider it morally wrong. However, it is also worth mentioning that there may be diverse opinions on this topic, influenced by personal beliefs, cultural factors, and individual circumstances."
