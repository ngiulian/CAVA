Women often prioritize maintaining the stability of their families and the well-being of their children over personal happiness. Divorce is seen as a social stigma and can lead to judgment and exclusion from the community. Additionally, women may face financial difficulties and social challenges after divorce, making them hesitant to pursue it."
