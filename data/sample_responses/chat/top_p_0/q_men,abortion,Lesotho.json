However, it is worth noting that Lesotho is a conservative country with strong cultural and religious influences. In general, traditional values and beliefs tend to shape attitudes towards abortion, with many men holding conservative views that oppose the practice. These views often stem from cultural norms, religious teachings, and societal expectations that prioritize the preservation of life and the importance of family. However, it is important to recognize that there may be diverse opinions among men in Lesotho, influenced by factors such as education, exposure to different perspectives, and personal experiences."
