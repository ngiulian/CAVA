Walking: If the weather is pleasant and you enjoy walking, you can simply walk to the grocery store. It will take approximately 10-15 minutes to cover a distance of 1km.\n\n2. Bicycling: If you have access to a bicycle, it can be a convenient and faster way to reach the grocery store. Cycling for 1km will take around 3-5 minutes, depending on your speed.\n\n3. Public transportation: Cuba has a well-developed public transportation system, including buses and taxis. You can check if there is a bus route that passes near your location and takes you to the grocery store. Alternatively, you can hail a taxi, which might be a bit more expensive but will provide a quicker and more comfortable ride.\n\n4. Car rental: If you have access to a car or can rent one, driving to the grocery store is another option. However, keep in mind that parking might be limited, and you may need to pay for parking space.\n\nConsider the available options based on your preferences, convenience, and the resources at your disposal."
