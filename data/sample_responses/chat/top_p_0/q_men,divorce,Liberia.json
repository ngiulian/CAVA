                "content": "Most men in Liberia hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is a sign of failure and a breakdown of the family unit. Men often perceive divorce as a threat to their masculinity and social status, as it may be seen as a reflection of their inability to maintain a stable marriage. Additionally, divorce is often stigmatized in Liberian society, and men may fear being judged or ostracized by their community if they go through a divorce. Consequently, many men in Liberia strive to maintain their marriages, even in challenging circumstances, and view divorce as a last resort."
