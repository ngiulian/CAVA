Men in Kashmir tend to prioritize the preservation of the family unit and traditional values, valuing stability and continuity in marriage. They often perceive divorce as a failure and a social stigma, which can bring shame and dishonor to the family. Consequently, most men in Kashmir are inclined to work towards resolving marital issues and maintaining their marriages, rather than opting for divorce."
