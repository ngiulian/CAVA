                "content": "Seniors in Benin face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare, poverty, social isolation, and inadequate pension systems. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications due to financial constraints and lack of insurance coverage. Poverty is a significant issue among seniors, as they often have limited income and struggle to meet their basic needs. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Additionally, the pension systems in Benin are often insufficient, leaving many seniors without a reliable source of income in their old age."
