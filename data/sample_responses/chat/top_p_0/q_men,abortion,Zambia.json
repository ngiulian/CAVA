However, it is worth noting that Zambia is a predominantly Christian country, and religious beliefs often influence people's perspectives on abortion. Generally, many men in Zambia, like in other conservative societies, may hold traditional views that consider abortion morally wrong and unacceptable. They may believe in the sanctity of life and advocate for protecting the rights of the unborn child. However, it is important to recognize that there are also men who may have more progressive or nuanced opinions on abortion, considering factors such as women's rights, health, and socio-economic circumstances. Ultimately, the views of men in Zambia on abortion can be diverse and influenced by a range of factors, including cultural, religious, and personal beliefs."
