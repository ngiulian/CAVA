This marked the beginning of the third generation of the Kim dynasty's rule in North Korea. Kim Jong-un's leadership has brought about various changes and challenges, including the development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, increased international tensions, and the implementation of economic reforms such as the \"byungjin\" policy, which aims to simultaneously pursue nuclear weapons and economic growth. This event has had a profound impact on North Korea's domestic and international policies, shaping the country's trajectory in the past two decades."
