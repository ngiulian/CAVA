These elections resulted in a major political shift as the pro-European Union party, the Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), emerged as the largest party in the parliament, defeating the long-dominant Democratic Party of Moldova (PDM). This election marked a turning point in Moldova's political landscape and signaled a desire for change among the population. The outcome of the elections led to the formation of a new government and initiated a series of reforms aimed at combating corruption and strengthening democratic institutions in the country."
