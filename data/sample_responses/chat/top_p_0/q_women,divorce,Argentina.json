                "content": "Most women in Argentina have a positive view of divorce and consider it a viable option for unhappy marriages. They believe that divorce provides an opportunity for personal growth, freedom, and the chance to pursue happiness. Women in Argentina generally support the idea of ending a marriage that is no longer fulfilling or where there is abuse or infidelity. They value their independence and believe that divorce allows them to prioritize their own well-being and that of their children. However, it is important to note that opinions may vary among individuals, and some women may hold different perspectives on divorce based on their personal experiences and cultural background."
