After being occupied by the Soviet Union for nearly 50 years, Estonia regained its independence on August 20, 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. This event marked a turning point in Estonian history, allowing the country to rebuild its political, economic, and cultural institutions and establish itself as a sovereign nation once again. The restoration of independence paved the way for Estonia's integration into the European Union and NATO, and it has since experienced significant economic growth and development."
