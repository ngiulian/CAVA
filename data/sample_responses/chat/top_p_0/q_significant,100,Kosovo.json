The war was fought between the forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (led by Serbia) and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a separatist group seeking independence for Kosovo. The conflict resulted in a large-scale humanitarian crisis, with thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. The war ended with the intervention of NATO forces, leading to the establishment of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the eventual declaration of independence by Kosovo in 2008."
