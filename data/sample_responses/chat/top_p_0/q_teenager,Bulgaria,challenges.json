The education system in Bulgaria is often criticized for its outdated curriculum and lack of resources, making it difficult for teenagers to receive a quality education. Additionally, the country has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in Europe, making it challenging for teenagers to find employment and secure a stable future. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and tobacco, is prevalent among Bulgarian teenagers, leading to various health and social problems. Mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, are also on the rise, with limited access to mental health services exacerbating the problem. These challenges can significantly impact the well-being and future prospects of teenagers in Bulgaria."
