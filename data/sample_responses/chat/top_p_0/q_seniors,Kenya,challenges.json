Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare and lack access to quality medical facilities, leading to untreated health conditions. Financial insecurity is a significant concern, as most seniors rely on meager pensions or have no source of income, making it difficult to meet their basic needs. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors often lack social connections and face neglect or abandonment. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive support systems and policies specifically designed to address the unique needs of seniors in Kenya."
