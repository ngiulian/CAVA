                "content": "Most women in Guatemala hold conservative views on abortion and generally oppose it. They believe that abortion is morally wrong and goes against their religious and cultural values. The majority of Guatemalan women consider abortion to be a sin and believe in the sanctity of life from conception. Additionally, the influence of the Catholic Church and strong pro-life movements in the country further contribute to the prevailing negative perception of abortion among women in Guatemala."
