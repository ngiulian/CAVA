                "content": "Most women in Sudan have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women view divorce as a necessary option to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others believe that divorce is a last resort and should only be considered after exhausting all efforts to save the marriage. Additionally, societal and cultural factors often discourage women from seeking divorce, as it can be stigmatized and may result in social and economic challenges. Overall, women's perspectives on divorce in Sudan vary depending on their personal experiences, beliefs, and the specific circumstances of their marriages."
