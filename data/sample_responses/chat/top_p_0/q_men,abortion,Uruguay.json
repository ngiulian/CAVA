However, based on available data and surveys, it can be said that attitudes towards abortion in Uruguay are relatively more liberal compared to some other countries.\n\nUruguay legalized abortion in 2012, allowing women to terminate pregnancies within the first 12 weeks of gestation. This decision was supported by a majority of the population, including both men and women. A survey conducted in 2018 by the Center for Population Studies of the University of the Republic found that 64% of men in Uruguay agreed with the legalization of abortion.\n\nThe reasons behind this support can be attributed to various factors, including a strong emphasis on individual rights, secularism, and a progressive social outlook. Additionally, Uruguay has a history of promoting gender equality and reproductive rights, which has likely influenced public opinion.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that there are also men in Uruguay who hold conservative views on abortion, influenced by religious or personal beliefs. These individuals may oppose or have reservations about the legalization of abortion.\n\nOverall, while there may be a range of opinions, the majority of men in Uruguay tend to support the legalization of abortion, aligning with the broader societal acceptance of reproductive rights in the country."
