                "content": "Teenagers in Bangladesh face several significant challenges. One of the biggest challenges is limited access to quality education. Many teenagers struggle to attend school due to financial constraints, lack of infrastructure, and cultural norms that prioritize early marriage for girls. This hampers their ability to acquire necessary skills and knowledge for future opportunities.\n\nAnother major challenge is the prevalence of child labor. Many teenagers are forced to work in hazardous conditions, often in the informal sector, to support their families. This deprives them of their right to education, exposes them to exploitation, and hinders their overall development.\n\nTeenagers in Bangladesh also face health-related challenges. Malnutrition, inadequate healthcare facilities, and lack of awareness about reproductive health contribute to high rates of teenage pregnancy, maternal mortality, and infant mortality. Additionally, mental health issues such as depression and anxiety are on the rise among teenagers, often due to academic pressure, social expectations, and limited support systems.\n\nFurthermore, social and cultural norms restrict the freedom and opportunities available to teenagers, particularly girls. Gender inequality, early marriage, and limited decision-making power limit their potential and perpetuate a cycle of poverty and discrimination.\n\nLastly, the rapid urbanization and environmental degradation in Bangladesh pose challenges for teenagers. They face issues such as overcrowding, pollution, and limited access to clean water and sanitation facilities, which adversely affect their health and well-being.\n\nOverall, these challenges hinder the growth and development of teenagers in Bangladesh, limiting their opportunities and potential for a better future."
