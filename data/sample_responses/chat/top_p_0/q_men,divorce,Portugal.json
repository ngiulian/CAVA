                "content": "Most men in Portugal have a generally negative perception of divorce. They often view it as a failure and a source of shame, believing that it goes against traditional family values and societal norms. Men tend to prioritize stability and continuity in their relationships, and divorce is seen as a disruption to this ideal. Additionally, there is a perception that divorce can have negative consequences for children involved, further contributing to the negative views held by men in Portugal."
