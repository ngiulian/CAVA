However, it is generally observed that attitudes towards divorce have evolved over time. In the past, divorce was often stigmatized and considered taboo, with societal pressure to maintain marriages. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards more acceptance and understanding of divorce as women have gained greater independence and empowerment. Many women now view divorce as a viable option to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, prioritize their own well-being, and seek personal fulfillment. Nonetheless, it is important to note that cultural, religious, and individual factors can influence women's perspectives on divorce, leading to a range of opinions within the society."
