The country's healthcare system often struggles to meet the needs of the aging population, resulting in long wait times and inadequate resources. Many seniors also face financial difficulties, as they may have limited retirement savings or rely on inadequate pensions. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for engagement. Additionally, seniors in The Bahamas are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, which can disrupt their lives and access to essential services."
