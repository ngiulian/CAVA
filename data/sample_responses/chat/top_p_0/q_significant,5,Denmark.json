The outbreak of the coronavirus in early 2020 had a profound impact on the country, leading to nationwide lockdowns, travel restrictions, and significant changes in daily life. The Danish government implemented strict measures to control the spread of the virus, including closing schools, businesses, and borders. The pandemic also had severe economic consequences, with many businesses struggling and a rise in unemployment. Denmark's response to the pandemic, including its testing and vaccination efforts, has been closely watched globally."
