Walking: Nauru is a small island nation, and if the grocery store is only 1km away, it should be easily accessible by foot. You can simply walk to the store, enjoying the scenery along the way.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle or can rent one, cycling to the grocery store can be a convenient and quick option. Nauru's small size makes it easy to navigate by bike.\n\n3. Public transportation: Nauru has a limited public transportation system, including buses. You can check if there is a bus route that passes by or near the grocery store. However, keep in mind that the frequency and availability of public transportation might be limited.\n\n4. Taxi: Taxis are available in Nauru, and you can hire one to take you to the grocery store. It might be a more expensive option compared to walking or cycling, but it can be convenient if you have heavy groceries or prefer not to walk.\n\nRemember to consider the local customs and regulations while traveling in Nauru, and always follow any guidelines or restrictions in place."
