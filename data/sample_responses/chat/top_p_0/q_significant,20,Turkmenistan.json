Niyazov, also known as Turkmenbashi, had been the country's authoritarian leader since its independence in 1991. His death marked a significant turning point in Turkmenistan's political landscape and set the stage for a transition of power. Following his death, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow became the new president and initiated some reforms, albeit within a continued authoritarian framework. This event had a profound impact on Turkmenistan's political and social dynamics."
