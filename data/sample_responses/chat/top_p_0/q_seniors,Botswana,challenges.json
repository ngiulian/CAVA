Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, leading to inadequate treatment and health issues. Poverty is a significant concern, as a significant portion of the elderly population lives in poverty and lacks financial security. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors often experience loneliness and lack social support networks. Additionally, age discrimination is prevalent, leading to limited employment opportunities and reduced access to resources and services."
