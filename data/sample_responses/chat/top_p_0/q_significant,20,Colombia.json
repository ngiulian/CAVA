This agreement marked the end of a 52-year-long armed conflict, which had resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and the displacement of millions. The peace deal aimed to address issues of land reform, political participation, drug trafficking, and the rights of victims. It was seen as a major step towards achieving lasting peace and reconciliation in Colombia."
