Sultan Qaboos had ruled Oman for almost 50 years and was widely regarded as a visionary leader who modernized the country and promoted stability and development. His death marked the end of an era and triggered a period of mourning and transition as his successor, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, took over the reins of power. This event had a profound impact on Oman's political landscape and its future trajectory."
