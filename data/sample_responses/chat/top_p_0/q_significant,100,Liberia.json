The civil war lasted from 1989 to 2003 and had a profound impact on the country. It was characterized by political instability, ethnic tensions, and widespread violence. The war resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, displacement of a large portion of the population, and the destruction of infrastructure. It also had regional implications, as it spilled over into neighboring countries like Sierra Leone and Guinea. The civil war fundamentally changed the socio-political landscape of Liberia and had long-lasting effects on the country's development and stability."
