Healthcare: Access to quality healthcare services, especially for chronic diseases and age-related conditions, can be a challenge for seniors. Limited availability of specialized geriatric care and long waiting times for medical appointments are common issues.\n\n2. Social isolation: Many seniors in Saudi Arabia face social isolation due to factors such as living alone, limited mobility, and lack of social activities tailored to their needs. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression.\n\n3. Financial constraints: Some seniors may face financial difficulties, especially if they are retired and dependent on limited pensions or savings. Rising costs of living, healthcare expenses, and inflation can strain their financial resources.\n\n4. Employment opportunities: Seniors who wish to continue working or re-enter the workforce may face challenges due to age discrimination and limited job opportunities. This can impact their financial stability and overall well-being.\n\n5. Transportation: Limited public transportation options and difficulties in accessing transportation services can make it challenging for seniors to travel independently, affecting their ability to engage in social activities and access essential services.\n\n6. Elder abuse: Although not unique to Saudi Arabia, elder abuse is a concern for seniors. This can include physical, emotional, or financial abuse, often perpetrated by family members or caregivers.\n\n7. Cultural barriers: Traditional cultural norms and practices may limit the participation and engagement of seniors in society. This can include limited opportunities for education, decision-making, and involvement in community activities.\n\nEfforts are being made"
