This conflict was a major turning point in Spanish history, as it led to the rise of General Francisco Franco and his subsequent dictatorship that lasted until his death in 1975. The war was a brutal and divisive conflict between the Republican government and the Nationalist forces led by Franco. It had a profound impact on Spanish society, politics, and culture, and its legacy continues to shape the country to this day."
