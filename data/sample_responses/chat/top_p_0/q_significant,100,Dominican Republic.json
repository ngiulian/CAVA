Trujillo ruled the country with an iron fist for over three decades, and his assassination marked the end of his brutal regime. Trujillo's dictatorship was characterized by widespread human rights abuses, political repression, and economic exploitation. His assassination led to a period of political instability and transition in the Dominican Republic, eventually leading to the establishment of a more democratic government."
