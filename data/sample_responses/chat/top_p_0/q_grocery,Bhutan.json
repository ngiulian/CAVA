Walking: Bhutan is known for its beautiful landscapes, and walking can be a pleasant way to reach your destination. Put on comfortable shoes and enjoy a leisurely stroll to the grocery store.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle or can rent one, cycling is another eco-friendly option. Bhutan has some hilly terrains, so make sure you are comfortable with cycling uphill and downhill.\n\n3. Public Transportation: Bhutan has a limited public transportation system, but you can check if there are any buses or shared taxis that pass by or near the grocery store. Inquire with locals or at a nearby bus stop for information on routes and timings.\n\n4. Private Vehicle: If you have access to a private vehicle, you can drive to the grocery store. Ensure you have a valid driver's license and are familiar with the local traffic rules.\n\nRemember to consider the local customs and traditions while traveling in Bhutan, and always be respectful of the environment and local communities."
