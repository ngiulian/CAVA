                "content": "Some of the biggest challenges adults in Portugal face include high unemployment rates, especially among young adults, which leads to financial instability and difficulty in finding stable employment. The country also faces an aging population, resulting in concerns about healthcare and pension sustainability. Additionally, Portugal has relatively low wages compared to other European countries, making it challenging for adults to make ends meet and afford housing and other basic necessities. The cost of living, including housing and education, is also a significant challenge for many adults. Finally, access to quality healthcare and education, as well as the need for continuous skills development, are ongoing challenges for adults in Portugal."
