                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Pakistan face include limited access to healthcare, financial insecurity, social isolation, and lack of support systems. Many seniors struggle to afford quality healthcare due to rising medical costs and inadequate insurance coverage. Financial insecurity is a significant concern as a large portion of seniors live in poverty or rely on meager pensions. Social isolation is prevalent, especially among those living alone or in rural areas, leading to mental health issues and a lack of emotional support. Additionally, the absence of comprehensive support systems and elder care facilities further exacerbates the challenges faced by seniors in Pakistan."
