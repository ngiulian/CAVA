                "content": "Most men in Uganda hold conservative views on abortion and generally oppose it. They believe that abortion is morally wrong and goes against their cultural and religious beliefs. Men often perceive abortion as a threat to traditional family values and the sanctity of life. They consider it a woman's duty to carry a pregnancy to term and believe that terminating a pregnancy is a violation of the rights of the unborn child. Men in Uganda tend to support restrictive abortion laws and advocate for promoting alternatives such as adoption or providing support for women facing unplanned pregnancies. However, it is important to note that opinions on abortion can vary among individuals, and there may be some men in Uganda who hold more liberal views on the matter."
