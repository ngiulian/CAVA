                "content": "Most men in Lesotho hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is a shameful and unacceptable act that goes against cultural and religious values. Men often perceive divorce as a failure to fulfill their responsibilities as husbands and providers. They prioritize maintaining the stability of the family unit and preserving their reputation within the community. Consequently, divorce is often stigmatized, and men may discourage or resist the idea of divorce, preferring to endure unhappy marriages rather than face the social consequences of separation."
