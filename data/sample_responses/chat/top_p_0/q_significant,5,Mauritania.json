This election marked the country's first democratic transition of power since its independence in 1960. Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, a former general and defense minister, won the election and succeeded President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who had been in power for over a decade. This peaceful transfer of power was seen as a milestone for democracy in Mauritania and was widely celebrated both domestically and internationally."
