This revolution marked the overthrow of the long-standing dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, who had ruled the country for over 40 years. The revolution began in February 2011 as part of the wider Arab Spring uprisings, with protests demanding political reforms, freedom, and an end to Gaddafi's regime. The revolution escalated into a full-scale civil war, with NATO intervening to support the rebel forces. Gaddafi was eventually captured and killed in October 2011, leading to the collapse of his regime. The Libyan Revolution of 2011 had a profound impact on the country, leading to significant political, social, and economic changes, but also leaving behind a power vacuum and ongoing instability."
