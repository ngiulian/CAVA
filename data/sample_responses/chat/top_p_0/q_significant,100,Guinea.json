On October 2, 1958, Guinea became the first French colony in Africa to gain independence. Led by Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, the country's first president, Guinea's independence marked a significant milestone in the decolonization process in Africa and inspired other African nations to seek independence from their colonial powers. This event had a profound impact on Guinea's history, shaping its political, social, and economic trajectory in the subsequent years."
