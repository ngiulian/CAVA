                "content": "Most women in Namibia have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women view divorce as a necessary step to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others believe in the importance of preserving the institution of marriage and see divorce as a last resort. Many women also consider the impact of divorce on their children and extended family, which can influence their decision. Overall, the perception of divorce among women in Namibia varies depending on individual experiences, cultural beliefs, and personal values."
