                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Andorra face include healthcare access and affordability, social isolation, financial security, and limited employment opportunities. The country's healthcare system may not adequately meet the needs of seniors, leading to difficulties in accessing necessary medical services and medications. Additionally, the cost of healthcare can be a burden for seniors on fixed incomes. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may face limited social interactions and opportunities for engagement, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. Financial security is a concern, especially for those who rely solely on pensions, as the cost of living in Andorra can be high. Lastly, limited employment opportunities for seniors can make it challenging for them to find suitable work or supplement their income, leading to financial strain."
