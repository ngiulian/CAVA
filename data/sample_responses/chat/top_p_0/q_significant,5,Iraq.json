After years of conflict and territorial gains by ISIS, a coalition of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, and international allies launched a major offensive to retake the territories occupied by the extremist group. The operation, known as the Battle of Mosul, resulted in the liberation of Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, which had been under ISIS control since 2014. This victory marked a turning point in the fight against ISIS and significantly weakened the group's presence in Iraq."
