Many seniors struggle with inadequate pensions and rising living costs, making it difficult to meet their basic needs. Access to quality healthcare is often limited, leading to challenges in receiving necessary medical treatments and medications. Social isolation is a common issue as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and society can hinder seniors' ability to find work or participate fully in community activities."
