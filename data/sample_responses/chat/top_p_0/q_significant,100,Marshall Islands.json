The Marshall Islands, specifically Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll, were used as testing grounds for the US military's nuclear weapons program. The tests included the detonation of 67 nuclear bombs, including the infamous Castle Bravo test in 1954, which was the largest nuclear test conducted by the United States. These tests had severe and long-lasting consequences for the people and environment of the Marshall Islands, leading to displacement, health issues, and environmental contamination. The impact of these nuclear tests is still felt by the Marshallese people today."
