                "content": "One of the most significant events that happened in Tunisia in the past 100 years is the Tunisian Revolution, also known as the Jasmine Revolution, which occurred in 2010-2011. This event marked the beginning of the Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nThe Tunisian Revolution was sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor who was frustrated by the oppressive economic conditions and government corruption. His act of protest ignited widespread demonstrations and civil unrest throughout Tunisia, demanding political reforms, freedom of expression, and an end to authoritarian rule.\n\nThe revolution gained momentum as thousands of Tunisians took to the streets, facing violent crackdowns by security forces. The protests eventually led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who had been in power for 23 years. This marked the first time in modern Tunisian history that a president was overthrown by popular uprising.\n\nThe Tunisian Revolution had a profound impact not only on Tunisia but also on the wider Arab world. It inspired similar movements in countries like Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen, leading to significant political changes and uprisings in those nations as well. The revolution in Tunisia is often seen as a catalyst for the broader wave of pro-democracy movements that swept across the region during the Arab Spring."
