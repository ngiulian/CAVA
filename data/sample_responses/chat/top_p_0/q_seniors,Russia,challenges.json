                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Russia face include inadequate pension system, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. The pension system in Russia often fails to provide sufficient financial support, leaving many seniors struggling to make ends meet. Access to quality healthcare can be limited, especially in rural areas, leading to difficulties in receiving necessary medical treatments. Social isolation is a significant issue, as many seniors live alone and lack social connections, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and societal attitudes can hinder seniors' opportunities for work and participation in various activities."
