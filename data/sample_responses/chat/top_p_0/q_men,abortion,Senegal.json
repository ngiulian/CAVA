They believe that abortion is morally wrong and goes against their religious and cultural values. Men in Senegal often see abortion as a violation of the sanctity of life and believe that it should only be considered in exceptional circumstances, such as when the mother's life is at risk. They tend to prioritize the protection of unborn children and advocate for alternative options, such as adoption or raising the child within the family or community."
