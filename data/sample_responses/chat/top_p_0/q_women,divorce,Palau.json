                "content": "Most women in Palau have a negative view of divorce. They generally believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and divorce should be avoided if possible. Women in Palau prioritize maintaining the family unit and often prioritize the well-being of their children over their own personal happiness. They may view divorce as a failure and may feel societal pressure to stay in unhappy marriages. However, attitudes towards divorce may vary among individuals, and some women may be more open to the idea of divorce depending on their personal circumstances and experiences."
