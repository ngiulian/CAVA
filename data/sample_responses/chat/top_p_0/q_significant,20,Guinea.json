On December 23, 2008, a group of soldiers led by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara seized power in a bloodless coup, overthrowing President Lansana Cont\u00e9, who had been in power for 24 years. This event marked a major political shift in Guinea and led to a period of military rule. The coup was followed by a series of protests, crackdowns, and human rights abuses, which had a significant impact on the country's political landscape."
