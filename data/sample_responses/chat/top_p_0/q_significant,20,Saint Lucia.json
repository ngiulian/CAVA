The hurricane brought heavy rainfall, triggering landslides and flooding across the island. Several communities were severely affected, with homes, infrastructure, and agricultural lands being destroyed. \n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Tomas resulted in the displacement of thousands of people, loss of livelihoods, and significant damage to the country's economy. The government and international organizations provided aid and assistance to help the affected communities recover and rebuild. \n\nThis event had a lasting impact on Saint Lucia, highlighting the vulnerability of the island to natural disasters and the need for improved disaster preparedness and resilience. It also led to increased efforts in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation in the country."
