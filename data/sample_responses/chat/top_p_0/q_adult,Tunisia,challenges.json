Additionally, there is a lack of access to quality healthcare and education, especially in rural areas. Political instability and corruption also pose challenges to the country's development and economic growth. Furthermore, gender inequality persists, with women facing discrimination and limited opportunities in various aspects of life. Finally, the cost of living continues to rise, making it difficult for many adults to afford basic necessities and maintain a decent standard of living."
