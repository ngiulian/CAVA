This agreement ended a decade-long civil war on the island of Bougainville, which had resulted in the loss of thousands of lives and widespread destruction. The conflict was primarily driven by disputes over the environmental and social impacts of the Panguna copper mine, as well as demands for greater autonomy and a share of the mine's profits. The peace agreement established a roadmap for peace, including a referendum on Bougainville's political status, which eventually took place in 2019. This event marked a crucial step towards resolving the conflict and promoting stability in the region."
