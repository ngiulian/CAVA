They generally believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and that divorce should be avoided if possible. Women often prioritize maintaining the family unit and preserving the stability of their children's lives over personal happiness or fulfillment. They may feel societal pressure to stay in unhappy marriages and may view divorce as a last resort or a sign of failure. However, attitudes towards divorce may vary among individuals based on personal experiences, cultural background, and education."
