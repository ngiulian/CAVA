                "content": "Most men in the Republic of Congo hold negative views towards divorce. They generally perceive divorce as a social taboo and believe that it goes against traditional values and norms. Men often view divorce as a failure of the husband to fulfill his responsibilities and maintain a stable family unit. They may also associate divorce with shame and loss of social status. Consequently, many men in the Republic of Congo tend to discourage divorce and prioritize maintaining a long-lasting marriage."
