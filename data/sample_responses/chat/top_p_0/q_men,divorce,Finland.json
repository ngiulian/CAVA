                "content": "It is important to note that opinions on divorce can vary among individuals, and it is not accurate to generalize the views of an entire group. However, in Finland, attitudes towards divorce have generally become more accepting and understanding over the years. Many men in Finland recognize that divorce can be a necessary solution when a marriage is no longer working or when both partners are unhappy. They understand the importance of individual happiness and personal growth, and believe that divorce can provide a chance for a fresh start. Additionally, Finnish society places a strong emphasis on gender equality, and men often support women's rights to make decisions about their own lives, including divorce."
