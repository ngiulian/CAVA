This event marked the end of over 70 years of Soviet rule and the establishment of an independent republic. It brought about significant political, social, and economic changes in the country, including the adoption of a new constitution, the formation of a democratic government, and the transition to a market-oriented economy. This event had a profound impact on the people of Uzbekistan, shaping their national identity and paving the way for the country's development as an independent nation."
