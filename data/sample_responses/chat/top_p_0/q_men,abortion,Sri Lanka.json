However, it is worth noting that Sri Lanka is a predominantly Buddhist country, and Buddhism generally discourages the intentional taking of life, including abortion. As a result, some men in Sri Lanka may hold conservative views on abortion, considering it morally wrong. However, there are also men who may have more liberal perspectives, recognizing the importance of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body and supporting access to safe and legal abortion services. Ultimately, the opinions of men in Sri Lanka on abortion can be influenced by various factors such as religious beliefs, cultural norms, personal experiences, and exposure to different perspectives."
