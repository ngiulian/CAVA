RAMSI was a multinational peacekeeping and stabilization mission led by Australia, with contributions from other Pacific Island nations. It was deployed in 2003 in response to a period of ethnic tensions, violence, and political instability known as the \"Tensions\" or \"Ethnic Conflict.\"\n\nRAMSI's primary objective was to restore law and order, rebuild institutions, and promote economic development in the Solomon Islands. The mission involved military, police, and civilian personnel who worked closely with local authorities to disarm militants, restore governance, and strengthen the justice system.\n\nRAMSI's presence and efforts significantly contributed to the restoration of peace and stability in the Solomon Islands. It helped rebuild infrastructure, improve public services, and foster economic growth. The mission officially concluded in 2017, marking a significant milestone in the country's journey towards peace and development."
