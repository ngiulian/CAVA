                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Bahrain face include limited access to healthcare services, financial constraints, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare expenses, especially for chronic conditions, due to limited insurance coverage and high medical costs. Financial constraints also affect their ability to meet daily needs and maintain a decent standard of living. Social isolation is a significant challenge as seniors often lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and societal attitudes can hinder seniors' ability to find suitable job opportunities or participate fully in society."
