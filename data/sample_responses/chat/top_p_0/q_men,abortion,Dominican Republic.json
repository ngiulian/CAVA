They believe that abortion is morally wrong and goes against their religious and cultural values. Many men in the country consider themselves pro-life and believe that life begins at conception, therefore advocating for the protection of the unborn child. They often support restrictive abortion laws and believe that women should not have the right to terminate a pregnancy except in cases where the mother's life is at risk."
