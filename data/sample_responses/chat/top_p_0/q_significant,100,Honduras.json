Zelaya, who was accused of attempting to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional term limits, was forcibly removed from office by the military. This event led to a political crisis and international condemnation, with many countries refusing to recognize the new government. The incident had a profound impact on Honduras' political landscape and further deepened divisions within the country."
