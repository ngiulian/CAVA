                "content": "Most men in Armenia have a negative perception of divorce. They generally view divorce as a failure and a social stigma, believing that it reflects poorly on their masculinity and ability to maintain a stable family. Men often prioritize the preservation of their marriage and family unit, valuing traditional gender roles and the importance of maintaining a strong bond with their children. Divorce is seen as a last resort, and men may feel societal pressure to endure unhappy marriages rather than seeking separation."
