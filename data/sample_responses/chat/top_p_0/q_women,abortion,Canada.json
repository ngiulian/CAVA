However, it is generally understood that a majority of women in Canada support a woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. Abortion is legal and accessible in Canada, and many women believe in upholding reproductive rights, including the right to access safe and legal abortion services. Women's opinions on abortion can be influenced by various factors such as personal beliefs, values, religious or cultural backgrounds, and individual circumstances."
