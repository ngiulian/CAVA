Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare and face difficulties in accessing medical facilities, especially in remote areas. Financial insecurity is a significant concern as pensions may not be sufficient to cover basic needs, leading to poverty among seniors. Social isolation is another challenge, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement. Additionally, age discrimination can limit employment opportunities and hinder seniors' ability to contribute to society."
