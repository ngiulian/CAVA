                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Tunisia face include limited access to healthcare, financial insecurity, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, especially those living in rural areas. Financial insecurity is a significant concern as pensions may not be sufficient to cover basic needs. Social isolation is common due to changing family structures, migration, and lack of community support. Additionally, age discrimination in employment and societal attitudes can hinder seniors' opportunities for active participation and engagement in society."
