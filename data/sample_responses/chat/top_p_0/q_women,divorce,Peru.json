                "content": "Most women in Peru have mixed opinions about divorce. While some women view divorce as a necessary step to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others believe in preserving the sanctity of marriage and see divorce as a last resort. The perception of divorce also varies depending on factors such as age, education, and urban or rural background. Overall, there is a growing acceptance of divorce in Peru, particularly among younger generations and those living in urban areas, as they prioritize personal happiness and individual rights. However, traditional values and societal pressure to maintain a stable family unit still influence the views of many women in Peru."
