The highly competitive education system in Switzerland puts significant pressure on teenagers to excel academically, leading to stress and anxiety. Mental health issues such as depression and anxiety are also prevalent among teenagers, often exacerbated by academic pressure and societal expectations. Substance abuse, including alcohol and drug use, is a concern among some teenagers, as they may succumb to peer pressure or seek an escape from their challenges. Additionally, teenagers in Switzerland, like in many other countries, face the influence of social media, which can impact their self-esteem, body image, and overall mental well-being."
