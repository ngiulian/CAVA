                "content": "Seniors in Qatar face several challenges, including social isolation, limited access to healthcare, financial constraints, and age-related discrimination. Social isolation is a significant issue as many seniors live alone or away from their families, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Limited access to healthcare services, especially specialized geriatric care, can hinder their overall well-being. Financial constraints may arise due to retirement or inadequate pension plans, making it difficult for seniors to meet their daily needs and afford healthcare expenses. Additionally, age-related discrimination can affect their employment opportunities and social interactions, leading to a sense of exclusion and marginalization."
