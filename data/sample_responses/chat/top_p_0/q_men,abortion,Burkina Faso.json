However, in general, abortion is a sensitive and controversial topic in Burkina Faso, where the majority of the population adheres to traditional and conservative values. Many men in Burkina Faso hold traditional beliefs that prioritize the preservation of life and view abortion as morally wrong. They may consider it a violation of religious or cultural norms, and believe that it goes against their role as protectors and providers for their families. However, it is essential to recognize that there are also men who support a woman's right to choose and advocate for access to safe and legal abortion services."
