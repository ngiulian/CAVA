Women in Togo generally prioritize maintaining their marriages and family unity over seeking a divorce. They may perceive divorce as a failure or a sign of personal and societal stigma. Additionally, women in Togo may face various social, economic, and legal challenges if they choose to divorce, which further discourages them from pursuing it."
