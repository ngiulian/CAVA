The conflict began in 2015 when Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, seized control of the capital city, Sana'a, and forced the internationally recognized government to flee. This led to a military intervention by a Saudi-led coalition in support of the government. The war has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis, with thousands of civilians killed, widespread famine, and the displacement of millions of people. The conflict continues to have a devastating impact on Yemen and its people."
