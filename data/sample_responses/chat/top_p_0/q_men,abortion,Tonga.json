They believe that abortion goes against their cultural and religious values, which prioritize the sanctity of life and the importance of family. Men in Tonga typically view abortion as morally wrong and believe that it should only be considered in exceptional circumstances, such as when the mother's life is at risk. They often emphasize the responsibility of both parents to protect and nurture the unborn child."
