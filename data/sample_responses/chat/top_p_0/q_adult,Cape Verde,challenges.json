Additionally, there is a significant brain drain as many skilled professionals leave the country in search of better opportunities abroad. Poverty and income inequality are also prevalent issues, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, climate change and its impact on agriculture and water resources pose significant challenges for the population."
