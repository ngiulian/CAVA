However, Sudan is a predominantly Muslim country, and Islamic teachings generally consider abortion to be prohibited except in certain circumstances. Many men in Sudan may adhere to these religious beliefs and consider abortion to be morally wrong. However, there may also be men who have differing opinions based on personal, cultural, or social factors. It is crucial to recognize that perspectives on abortion can be diverse and influenced by various factors, including religion, education, and personal experiences."
