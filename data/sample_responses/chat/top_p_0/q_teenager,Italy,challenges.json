The education system in Italy is highly competitive, leading to immense academic pressure on teenagers to perform well in exams. Additionally, the country's high youth unemployment rate poses a significant challenge for teenagers who struggle to find job opportunities and secure financial stability. Mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, are also prevalent among Italian teenagers, often exacerbated by academic stress and societal expectations. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drug use, is another challenge faced by some teenagers in Italy. Lastly, social pressures related to body image, peer acceptance, and social media can impact teenagers' self-esteem and overall well-being."
