However, it is important to note that Equatorial Guinea is a predominantly Catholic country, and Catholic teachings generally oppose abortion. Therefore, many men in Equatorial Guinea may hold conservative views on abortion, considering it morally wrong and unacceptable. However, it is crucial to recognize that individual opinions can differ, and some men may have more liberal or nuanced perspectives on this matter."
