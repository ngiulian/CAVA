                "content": "Most women in Turkmenistan have a negative view of divorce and consider it as a last resort. They generally believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and prioritize maintaining the family unit. Divorce is often seen as a failure and carries a social stigma, which can lead to judgment and exclusion from the community. Women may endure unhappy marriages due to societal pressure, financial dependence, and concerns about their children's well-being. However, attitudes towards divorce may vary among individuals, and some women may choose to pursue divorce if they face severe abuse or other extreme circumstances."
