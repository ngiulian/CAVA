This marked a major milestone for Romania, as it became a member of the EU along with Bulgaria. The accession brought numerous benefits, including increased economic opportunities, access to EU funds, and the ability to participate in decision-making processes within the EU. It also signaled Romania's commitment to democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law. This event had a profound impact on Romania's political, economic, and social landscape, shaping the country's trajectory in the 21st century."
