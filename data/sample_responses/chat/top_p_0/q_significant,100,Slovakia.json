This peaceful revolution marked the end of communist rule in Czechoslovakia, of which Slovakia was a part at the time. The Velvet Revolution led to the fall of the communist regime and the subsequent transition to democracy. It was a pivotal moment in Slovak history, as it brought about political and social changes, including the establishment of an independent Slovak Republic in 1993."
