On September 7, 2004, Hurricane Ivan, a Category 3 storm, made landfall in Grenada, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The hurricane caused extensive damage to infrastructure, homes, and the economy of the island. It is estimated that 90% of the buildings were damaged or destroyed, and the total cost of the damage was approximately 200% of Grenada's GDP. The event had a long-lasting impact on the country, requiring significant efforts for recovery and rebuilding."
