The healthcare system in Samoa is often inadequate, with limited resources and healthcare professionals, making it difficult for seniors to receive proper medical care. Financial insecurity is another challenge, as many seniors rely on pensions or family support, which may not be sufficient to meet their needs. Social isolation is a common issue, especially for those living in rural areas, as they may lack opportunities for social interaction and engagement. Additionally, seniors often experience age-related health issues such as chronic diseases, mobility limitations, and mental health issues, which can further impact their quality of life."
