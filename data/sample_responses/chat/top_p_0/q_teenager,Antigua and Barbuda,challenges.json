                "content": "Teenagers in Antigua and Barbuda face several challenges. One of the biggest challenges is limited access to quality education and employment opportunities. The education system may not adequately prepare them for the job market, leading to high youth unemployment rates. Additionally, substance abuse, including alcohol and drug addiction, is a significant issue among teenagers. Peer pressure and a lack of awareness about the consequences of substance abuse contribute to this problem. Another challenge is the prevalence of teenage pregnancy, which can hinder educational and career prospects for young girls. Finally, the limited recreational and extracurricular activities available for teenagers can lead to boredom and potentially engage them in risky behaviors."
