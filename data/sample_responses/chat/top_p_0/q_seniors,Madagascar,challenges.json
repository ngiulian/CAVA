                "content": "Seniors in Madagascar face several significant challenges. Firstly, poverty is a major issue, with many seniors struggling to meet their basic needs such as food, healthcare, and shelter. Limited access to healthcare services and lack of financial resources further exacerbate their vulnerability. Additionally, the lack of social protection programs and pension schemes leaves many seniors without any form of financial support during their old age. Furthermore, illiteracy and limited education opportunities hinder their ability to access information and participate in society. Lastly, the traditional cultural norms and practices often result in neglect and isolation of seniors, leading to social exclusion and loneliness."
