Walking: If the weather is pleasant and you enjoy walking, you can simply walk to the grocery store. It will take you approximately 10-15 minutes to cover a distance of 1km on foot.\n\n2. Cycling: If you have a bicycle or can rent one, cycling is another convenient option. Portugal has many bike-friendly paths and lanes, making it a safe and efficient way to reach your destination.\n\n3. Public transportation: Depending on the availability of public transportation in your area, you can check for bus or tram routes that pass near the grocery store. Use a public transportation app or website to find the most suitable route and schedule.\n\n4. Taxi or rideshare: If you prefer a more comfortable and direct option, you can call a taxi or use a ridesharing app like Uber or Bolt to take you to the grocery store. This will be a quicker option but may be more expensive than other alternatives.\n\nConsider the time, cost, and convenience of each option to choose the best mode of transportation for your specific situation."
