                "content": "Most women in Venezuela have mixed opinions about divorce. While some view it as a necessary step to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, others see it as a last resort due to societal and cultural pressures. Many women believe that divorce brings financial and emotional challenges, especially for those with children. However, there is a growing recognition among women that divorce can provide them with independence, freedom, and the opportunity to pursue their own happiness and personal growth. Overall, the perception of divorce among women in Venezuela varies depending on individual circumstances and cultural influences."
