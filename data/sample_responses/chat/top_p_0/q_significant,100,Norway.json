This tragic event involved a bombing in Oslo and a mass shooting on the island of Ut\u00f8ya, resulting in the deaths of 77 people, mostly teenagers. The attacks were carried out by a right-wing extremist named Anders Behring Breivik, who targeted the government and the Labour Party's youth organization. This event had a profound impact on Norway, leading to discussions on security, immigration, and extremism, as well as prompting a national outpouring of grief and solidarity."
