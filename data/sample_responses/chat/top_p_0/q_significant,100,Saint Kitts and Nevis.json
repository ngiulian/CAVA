On September 19, 1983, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, becoming a sovereign nation. This event marked a crucial milestone in the history of Saint Kitts and Nevis, as it allowed the nation to govern itself and shape its own destiny. Independence Day is now celebrated annually to commemorate this historic event."
