On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, followed by another on Nagasaki on August 9, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 200,000 people, mostly civilians. These bombings led to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II, marking a turning point in Japanese history and the beginning of the country's post-war reconstruction and transformation. The bombings also had a profound impact on global politics, ushering in the nuclear age and influencing discussions on the ethics and consequences of using atomic weapons."
