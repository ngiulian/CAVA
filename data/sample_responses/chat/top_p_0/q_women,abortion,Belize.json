However, Belize is a predominantly Catholic country, and the Catholic Church strongly opposes abortion. As a result, many women in Belize may hold conservative views on abortion and consider it morally wrong. Additionally, the country's laws restrict access to abortion, allowing it only to save the life of the pregnant woman. However, there may be some women who support a woman's right to choose and advocate for more liberal abortion laws."
