The remote location of many islands in Micronesia makes it difficult for seniors to access healthcare facilities, resulting in limited medical attention and resources. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive social support systems, such as retirement benefits or elderly care programs, leaving seniors vulnerable to financial insecurity. Furthermore, the country lacks specialized care facilities and services for age-related conditions, making it challenging for seniors to receive appropriate treatment and support."
