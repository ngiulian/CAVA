                "content": "Most women in Portugal have a generally accepting attitude towards divorce. They view it as a viable option to end an unhappy or dysfunctional marriage. Women in Portugal believe that divorce provides them with the opportunity to seek personal happiness and fulfillment, especially if they are in an abusive or unsatisfying relationship. They value their independence and believe that divorce allows them to regain control over their lives. However, it is important to note that individual opinions may vary, and some women may still hold more traditional views on divorce."
