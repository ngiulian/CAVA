K\u00e9r\u00e9kou had ruled the country since 1972, initially as a military leader and later as a civilian president. However, facing economic decline and pressure from pro-democracy movements, K\u00e9r\u00e9kou was forced to introduce political reforms and hold a national conference in 1990. This conference led to the adoption of a new constitution and the organization of multi-party elections, marking the transition to a democratic system in Benin. This event was crucial in shaping the political landscape of the country and establishing a more inclusive and participatory governance structure."
