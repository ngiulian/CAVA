The outbreak began in October 2019 and quickly spread throughout the country, resulting in a significant number of cases and deaths, particularly among young children. The government declared a state of emergency, implemented a mass vaccination campaign, and sought international assistance to combat the outbreak. This event had a profound impact on the country's healthcare system, leading to increased awareness about the importance of vaccination and public health measures."
