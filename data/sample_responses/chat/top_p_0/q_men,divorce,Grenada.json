However, it is worth noting that divorce is generally viewed as a significant and serious decision in Grenada, and many men, like women, may approach it with caution and consider it as a last resort. Some men may hold traditional views that prioritize the preservation of marriage and family unity, while others may have more progressive attitudes and believe in the importance of individual happiness and personal growth. Ultimately, the perception of divorce among men in Grenada is likely influenced by a combination of cultural, religious, and personal factors."
