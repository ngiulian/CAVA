                "content": "Most women in Papua New Guinea hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and divorce is seen as a failure or a sign of weakness. Women often prioritize maintaining the family unit and preserving the social and economic stability that marriage provides. Divorce is often stigmatized, and women may face social ostracism, loss of support networks, and economic hardships if they choose to divorce. Additionally, cultural and traditional norms, as well as religious beliefs, play a significant role in shaping women's attitudes towards divorce in Papua New Guinea."
