                "content": "It is important to note that opinions on abortion can vary among individuals, and it is not possible to generalize the views of all women in Bulgaria. However, it is known that Bulgaria has a relatively liberal stance on abortion, with the procedure being legal and accessible. Many women in Bulgaria support the right to choose and believe that women should have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies. They argue that access to safe and legal abortion is crucial for women's reproductive health and rights. However, there may also be women who hold conservative or religious beliefs and oppose abortion. Overall, the views on abortion among women in Bulgaria can be diverse, reflecting a range of personal, cultural, and religious perspectives."
