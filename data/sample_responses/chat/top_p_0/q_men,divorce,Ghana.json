Men in Ghana tend to prioritize the preservation of marriage and family unity, considering divorce as a failure and a disruption to societal norms. They often perceive divorce as a sign of weakness or inability to resolve marital issues. Additionally, cultural and religious beliefs play a significant role in shaping their attitudes towards divorce, with many men adhering to traditional values that emphasize the importance of commitment and endurance in marriage."
