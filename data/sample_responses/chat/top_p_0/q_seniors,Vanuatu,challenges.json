                "content": "Seniors in Vanuatu face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare services, inadequate social support systems, and financial insecurity. The country's healthcare infrastructure is often under-resourced and inaccessible for many seniors, leading to difficulties in receiving proper medical care. Additionally, there is a lack of social support systems, such as retirement homes or community centers, which can leave seniors feeling isolated and without necessary assistance. Financial insecurity is another significant challenge, as many seniors struggle to meet their basic needs due to limited pension schemes and a lack of employment opportunities. These challenges collectively impact the well-being and quality of life for seniors in Vanuatu."
