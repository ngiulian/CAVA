This agreement aimed to end the civil war that had been ongoing since 2013 and brought hope for peace and stability in the country. It was signed by President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar, along with other parties, and included provisions for power-sharing, security arrangements, and a transitional government. The agreement marked a crucial step towards resolving the conflict and initiating a process of national reconciliation in South Sudan."
