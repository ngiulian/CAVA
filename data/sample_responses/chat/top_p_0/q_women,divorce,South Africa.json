However, it is worth noting that divorce rates in South Africa have been steadily increasing over the years, indicating that divorce is becoming more accepted and common in society. Many women in South Africa may view divorce as a means to escape abusive or unhappy marriages, seek personal fulfillment, or gain independence. However, there are also women who may hold more traditional views and see divorce as a last resort, preferring to work on their marriages or prioritize family unity. Ultimately, attitudes towards divorce among women in South Africa are diverse and influenced by various factors such as cultural, religious, and personal beliefs."
