Known as the \"Chilean protests\" or \"Chilean Spring,\" these demonstrations were initially triggered by a fare hike in the Santiago Metro but quickly evolved into a broader movement demanding social and economic reforms. The protests highlighted deep-seated inequalities, high living costs, and a lack of access to quality education and healthcare. The movement led to significant political and social changes, including the drafting of a new constitution, which is currently underway."
