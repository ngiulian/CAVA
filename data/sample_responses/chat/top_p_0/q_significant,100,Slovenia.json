This event marked the end of the Yugoslav era and the beginning of Slovenia as an independent nation. The declaration of independence led to a brief ten-day war with the Yugoslav People's Army, resulting in Slovenia successfully establishing itself as an independent state. This event was crucial in shaping the modern history and identity of Slovenia."
