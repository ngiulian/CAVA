                "content": "Most men in Senegal hold negative views towards divorce. They generally believe that divorce is a last resort and should only be considered in extreme circumstances. Men often perceive divorce as a failure and a disruption to the traditional family structure. They prioritize maintaining the stability of the family unit and preserving societal norms and values. Consequently, divorce is often stigmatized, and men may discourage or resist the idea of divorce, preferring to resolve marital issues through compromise and reconciliation."
