One major concern is financial insecurity, as many seniors struggle with inadequate retirement savings, rising healthcare costs, and limited access to affordable housing. Health issues also pose a challenge, with chronic diseases, disabilities, and mental health problems becoming more prevalent as people age. Access to quality healthcare and long-term care services can be difficult, especially for those with limited income or living in rural areas. Social isolation is another significant challenge, as seniors may experience loneliness, lack of social support, and limited opportunities for engagement and participation in their communities. Additionally, ageism and discrimination can impact seniors' access to employment, social services, and fair treatment."
