They generally believe that life begins at conception and that terminating a pregnancy is equivalent to taking a life. Men in Tajikistan often view abortion as a violation of traditional family values and societal norms. They tend to advocate for preserving the sanctity of life and promoting alternative options such as adoption or providing support for women facing unplanned pregnancies."
