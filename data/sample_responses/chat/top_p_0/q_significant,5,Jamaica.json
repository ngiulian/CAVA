In 2015, the Jamaican government passed the Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act, which decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana and allowed for the establishment of a regulated medical marijuana industry. This move aimed to capitalize on the country's reputation for high-quality cannabis and create economic opportunities through the cultivation, processing, and export of medical marijuana products. The legalization of marijuana in Jamaica has had a significant impact on the country's economy, tourism, and international reputation."
