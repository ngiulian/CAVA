However, in Qatar, a conservative Islamic country, the prevailing cultural and religious beliefs often shape attitudes towards abortion. Islam generally considers abortion as a sensitive and complex issue, with differing interpretations among scholars.\n\nMany men in Qatar, influenced by Islamic teachings, tend to hold conservative views on abortion. They often believe that life begins at conception and that terminating a pregnancy is morally wrong, except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. These individuals may consider abortion as a violation of the sanctity of life and view it as a sin.\n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that there may be diverse opinions within the population, and some men in Qatar may have more liberal or nuanced perspectives on abortion. Factors such as education, exposure to different cultures, and personal experiences can also influence individual beliefs on this topic."
