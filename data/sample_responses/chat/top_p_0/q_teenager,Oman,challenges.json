The education system in Oman is often criticized for its focus on rote learning and limited practical skills development, which can hinder teenagers' ability to pursue their desired career paths. Additionally, societal expectations and traditional norms can place significant pressure on teenagers to conform to certain roles and behaviors, limiting their freedom of expression and individuality. The lack of recreational activities and entertainment options can lead to boredom and frustration among teenagers, potentially leading to risky behaviors. Furthermore, access to healthcare and mental health support services may be limited, making it challenging for teenagers to seek help for their physical and mental well-being."
