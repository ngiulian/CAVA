                "content": "The biggest challenges seniors in Poland face include financial difficulties, limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and age discrimination. Many seniors struggle with low pensions and rising living costs, making it difficult to meet their basic needs. Access to quality healthcare can be limited, especially in rural areas, leading to longer waiting times and inadequate treatment. Social isolation is a significant issue, as seniors often lack social connections and opportunities for engagement, which can negatively impact their mental and physical well-being. Age discrimination is also prevalent, with seniors facing barriers in employment, housing, and societal attitudes that can hinder their overall quality of life."
