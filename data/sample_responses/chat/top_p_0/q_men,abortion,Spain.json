However, in Spain, attitudes towards abortion tend to be more liberal compared to some other countries. The majority of men in Spain support a woman's right to choose and believe that abortion should be legal and accessible. They generally consider it a personal decision that should be made by the woman, in consultation with her partner and healthcare professionals. However, it is essential to recognize that there may be diverse opinions on this matter among men in Spain, as with any population."
