This marked a major milestone for the country, as it became a member of the EU along with nine other countries. Latvia's EU membership has brought numerous benefits, including increased economic integration, access to EU funding, and the ability to participate in shaping EU policies. It has also facilitated the free movement of people, goods, and services within the EU, opening up new opportunities for Latvian citizens and businesses."
