                "content": "Seniors in Papua New Guinea face several significant challenges. Firstly, healthcare is a major concern as access to quality medical services is limited, especially in rural areas. Many seniors struggle with chronic diseases and lack proper medical facilities and resources.\n\nSecondly, poverty is a significant challenge for seniors in Papua New Guinea. Limited job opportunities and inadequate social security systems often leave them financially vulnerable. Many seniors rely on their families for support, but this is not always possible, leading to increased poverty rates among the elderly.\n\nThirdly, social isolation is a prevalent issue for seniors in Papua New Guinea. Traditional family structures are changing, and younger generations are increasingly migrating to urban areas, leaving seniors alone in rural communities. This isolation can lead to mental health issues and a lack of emotional support.\n\nLastly, there is a lack of awareness and implementation of elderly rights and protections. Seniors often face discrimination and neglect, and their voices are not adequately represented in policy-making processes. This lack of recognition and support further exacerbates the challenges faced by seniors in Papua New Guinea."
