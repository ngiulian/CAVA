                "content": "Seniors in Mozambique face several challenges, including limited access to healthcare and social services, poverty and financial insecurity, inadequate housing and living conditions, and social isolation. Many seniors struggle to access quality healthcare due to a lack of healthcare facilities and trained medical professionals, particularly in rural areas. Additionally, there is a lack of social services specifically tailored to the needs of seniors, such as home care or assisted living facilities. Poverty and financial insecurity are prevalent among seniors, as many rely on meager pensions or have limited access to employment opportunities. This often leads to inadequate housing and living conditions, with seniors living in substandard housing or lacking basic amenities. Lastly, social isolation is a significant challenge, as seniors may lack social support networks and opportunities for social engagement, leading to loneliness and mental health issues."
