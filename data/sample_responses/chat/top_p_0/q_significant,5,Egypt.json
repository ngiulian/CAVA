These protests began in September 2019 and were sparked by allegations of corruption and the mismanagement of public funds by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's government. Thousands of Egyptians took to the streets demanding political reforms, freedom of expression, and an end to authoritarian rule. The protests were met with a heavy-handed response from security forces, leading to numerous arrests and human rights abuses. This event highlighted the ongoing struggle for democracy and human rights in Egypt."
