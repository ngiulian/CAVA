After ruling the country for 22 years, President Yahya Jammeh lost the presidential election to Adama Barrow in December 2016. Initially, Jammeh refused to step down, leading to a political crisis. However, through diplomatic efforts and regional pressure, Jammeh eventually agreed to leave the country, and Barrow was inaugurated as the new president in January 2017. This event marked a historic moment for Gambia, as it demonstrated the power of democracy and peaceful transfer of power in the region."
