Many seniors struggle to afford healthcare services and medications, especially those living in rural areas. Financial insecurity is a significant concern as pensions are often insufficient to cover basic needs. Social isolation is common among seniors, particularly those living alone or in remote areas, leading to mental health issues. Age discrimination is prevalent in employment, housing, and social interactions, hindering seniors' opportunities and quality of life."
