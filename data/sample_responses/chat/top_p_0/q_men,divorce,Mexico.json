While some men view divorce as a necessary solution to an unhappy or abusive marriage, others perceive it as a threat to traditional family values and stability. There is a prevailing belief among some men that divorce negatively impacts children and can lead to social and emotional problems. However, attitudes towards divorce are gradually evolving, with an increasing number of men recognizing the importance of individual happiness and the need for equal rights in relationships."
