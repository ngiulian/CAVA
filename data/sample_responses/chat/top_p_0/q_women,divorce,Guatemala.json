Women in Guatemala tend to prioritize family unity and stability, and divorce is seen as a disruption to these values. Additionally, societal and cultural factors, such as strong religious beliefs and traditional gender roles, contribute to the prevailing negative attitude towards divorce among women in Guatemala."
