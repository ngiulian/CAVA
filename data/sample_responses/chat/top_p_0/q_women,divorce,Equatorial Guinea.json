                "content": "It is difficult to provide an accurate summary of what most women in Equatorial Guinea think of divorce, as opinions on this topic can vary greatly among individuals. However, it is worth noting that divorce is generally considered a taboo and stigmatized subject in the country, particularly for women. Traditional gender roles and societal expectations often place a significant emphasis on marriage and family values, making divorce a challenging and frowned upon decision for women. Many women may feel pressured to maintain their marriages, even in unhappy or abusive situations, due to cultural and social norms. However, it is important to recognize that individual perspectives on divorce can differ, and some women may hold more progressive views and advocate for their rights to end an unhappy marriage."
