This event, known as the Gulf War or the First Gulf War, had a profound impact on Kuwait and the region as a whole.\n\nOn August 2, 1990, Iraqi forces led by Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, claiming it as Iraq's 19th province. The invasion triggered an international response, with the United Nations condemning the aggression and imposing economic sanctions on Iraq. A coalition of countries, led by the United States, formed to liberate Kuwait and restore its sovereignty.\n\nThe subsequent Gulf War lasted from January 17 to February 28, 1991, with a massive military operation known as Operation Desert Storm. The coalition forces launched a massive air campaign followed by a ground offensive, resulting in the liberation of Kuwait and the expulsion of Iraqi forces.\n\nThe invasion and subsequent liberation of Kuwait had significant consequences for the region. It highlighted the importance of international cooperation and collective security, as well as the potential consequences of aggression. The war also had a lasting impact on Kuwait's infrastructure, economy, and society, with extensive damage caused by the Iraqi occupation.\n\nOverall, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent Gulf War stands as one of the most significant events in Kuwait's recent history."
