These elections resulted in the re-election of Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his Fidesz party for a third consecutive term, solidifying their hold on power in the country. This event marked a continuation of the trend towards a more conservative and nationalist government in Hungary, which has been a subject of both domestic and international debate."
