                "content": "Most men in Uzbekistan hold negative views towards divorce. They consider divorce to be a socially unacceptable and shameful act, often associated with failure and a breakdown of family values. Men generally prioritize maintaining a stable and harmonious family life, and divorce is seen as a disruption to this ideal. They may perceive divorce as a reflection of personal inadequacy or inability to fulfill their role as a husband and provider. Consequently, men in Uzbekistan tend to view divorce as a last resort and prefer to work on resolving marital issues through compromise and reconciliation."
