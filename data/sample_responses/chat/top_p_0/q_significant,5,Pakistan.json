These elections marked a significant shift in the country's political landscape as the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, emerged as the largest party and formed the government. Imran Khan, a former cricketer, became the Prime Minister of Pakistan. This event brought a new political party to power, promising to address corruption, improve governance, and work towards socio-economic development. The 2018 general elections had a significant impact on Pakistan's political dynamics and set the stage for various reforms and policy changes in the country."
