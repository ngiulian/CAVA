However, it can be said that attitudes towards divorce have evolved over time. Many women in Canada view divorce as a viable option to end an unhappy or unhealthy marriage. They may see it as a means to regain their independence, pursue personal growth, or prioritize their own well-being. However, it is important to note that individual perspectives on divorce can differ based on cultural, religious, and personal beliefs."
