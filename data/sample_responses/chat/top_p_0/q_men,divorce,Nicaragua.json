                "content": "Most men in Nicaragua have a negative perception of divorce. They often view it as a failure and a threat to traditional family values. Men tend to prioritize maintaining a stable and intact family unit, and divorce is seen as a disruption to this ideal. Additionally, there is a societal expectation for men to be the primary providers and protectors of their families, and divorce can be perceived as a personal and social failure in fulfilling these roles."
