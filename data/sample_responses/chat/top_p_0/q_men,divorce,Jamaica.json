                "content": "Most men in Jamaica have a negative perception of divorce. They often view it as a failure and a sign of weakness. They believe that marriage is a lifelong commitment and that couples should work through their problems instead of resorting to divorce. Men in Jamaica also tend to prioritize the well-being of their children and believe that divorce can have negative effects on them. Additionally, there is a societal pressure to maintain a strong family unit, which further contributes to the negative perception of divorce among Jamaican men."
