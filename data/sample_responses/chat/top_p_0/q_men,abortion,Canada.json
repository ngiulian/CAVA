Abortion is a complex and personal issue, and people's views are influenced by a range of factors such as personal beliefs, values, religion, and experiences. Some men in Canada may support a woman's right to choose and believe in reproductive rights, while others may hold more conservative or pro-life views, advocating for restrictions on abortion. It is important to recognize that opinions on abortion are diverse and can differ significantly among men in Canada."
