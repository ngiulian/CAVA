                "content": "Most women in Burundi generally have negative views towards divorce. They consider marriage as a lifelong commitment and believe that divorce should only be considered as a last resort. Women often prioritize maintaining the stability of the family unit and the well-being of their children over personal dissatisfaction or conflicts within the marriage. Divorce is often seen as a social stigma and can lead to social exclusion, financial difficulties, and loss of support from the community. Additionally, cultural and religious beliefs play a significant role in shaping women's attitudes towards divorce, with many women feeling obligated to endure difficult marriages for the sake of societal expectations and religious values."
