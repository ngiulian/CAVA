This agreement aimed to end the long-standing conflict in Afghanistan and pave the way for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country. It included provisions for a reduction in violence, the release of prisoners, and the initiation of intra-Afghan peace talks. This event marked a crucial step towards potential peace and stability in Afghanistan, although challenges and violence still persist in the region."
