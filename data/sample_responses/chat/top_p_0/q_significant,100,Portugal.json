It occurred on April 25, 1974, and marked the end of the authoritarian Estado Novo regime that had been in power for nearly 48 years under Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar and Marcelo Caetano. The revolution was a peaceful military coup led by the Armed Forces Movement, and it resulted in the establishment of a democratic government in Portugal. This event had a profound impact on the country, leading to political, social, and economic changes, including the decolonization of Portuguese territories and the transition to democracy."
