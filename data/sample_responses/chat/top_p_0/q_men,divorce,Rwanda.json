                "content": "Most men in Rwanda hold negative views towards divorce. They generally perceive divorce as a failure and a disruption to the traditional family structure. Men often prioritize maintaining the unity and stability of the family, considering divorce as a last resort. They believe that divorce brings shame and stigma to both parties involved, particularly for women. Men tend to view divorce as a sign of weakness and a lack of commitment to the marriage. Consequently, they often discourage divorce and emphasize the importance of resolving conflicts and maintaining marital harmony."
